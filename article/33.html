						<p>"Fan-go, you really shouldn't be daydreaming anymore. That guy, Yu Ang, is truly a psychopath. You don't even know if you'll see the sunlight on your 18th birthday, so forget about marrying the little princess."</p><p>"Yu Ang? Hmph, wait until I beat him into the ground!"</p><p>In the past, Mo Fan would still gauge whether he could defeat Mu Shi, but now, even the young generation of the Mu Family's descendants didn't scare him.</p><p>Left hand Fire Infusion, searing them from the outside while leaving them tender inside; right hand Thunder Seal, blasting them until their skin and flesh were torn apart!</p><p>...</p><p>Who is this Mo Fan? A godsend! His test scores are so impressive, surpassing Xu Zhao Ting of the Lightning School and Mu Bai of the Ice Family's prestigious lineage?</p><p>The results alone were enough to shock countless people. However, Mo Fan's public denunciation of Mu Zhuo Yun and his decisive battle with the Mu Family's descendants in front of school directors spread even faster around the school. Soon, Mo Fan became famous not only as a legend who transformed into a genius in one second but also as the most suicidal student in Bocheng history!</p><p>People with some experience knew that Tianlan Magic High School was set up for ordinary mages. Among its 1500 students were some quite capable individuals, but compared to certain higher-tier magic high schools and families with vast resources, they simply weren't in the same league. A mage from organizations like the Hunters' Alliance, the Magic Association, prominent clans, or major noble families could easily outperform them.</p><p>School was indeed the best opportunity for grassroots mages to rise to prominence, but it didn't mean they could fight against the children of spellcasters and magic heirs!</p><p>It was noteworthy that Mo Fan was assigned to the advanced class.</p><p>The advanced class had around 100 students who took classes in a large classroom and practiced in a big training ground.</p><p>Students in this advanced class generally controlled seven star essences, though some were still not particularly proficient at spell release.</p><p>Thus, during practical lessons, each department's top students showcased their talents!</p><p>The practical teacher was still Ms. Tang Yue. This new practical teacher was said to have cultivation surpassing any other practical teacher in the school. Despite having been there for less than half a year, she was teaching the advanced class.</p><p>The head teacher of the advanced class is still Xue Musheng.</p><p>His class produced two S-class students, who else could be this top student's head teacher?</p><p>This was all thanks to Mo Fan, who suddenly attracted a lot of attention from school leaders. Of course, the school leaders repeatedly emphasized that Xue Musheng must properly guide Mo Fan’s rebellious personality.</p><p>…</p><p>Before they knew it, another month had passed in the new semester.</p><p>Head teacher Xue Musheng stood in the large classroom of the advanced class and coughed heavily, signaling to all the students to control their excitement.</p><p>Why were the students so excited today?</p><p>Today was the day when the school would distribute Star Dust Artifacts. As students in the advanced class, besides having the best teachers, they also had an important benefit.</p><p>The reason why those major magic organizations and noble families were far ahead of civilian mages was not only due to their mastery of more extensive knowledge, secrets, and experience, but most importantly, they possessed Star Dust Artifacts.</p><p>To put it this way, if experience, knowledge, secrets, and teachings are considered software, then Star Dust Artifacts are solid hardware!</p><p>Other noble families had complete software and leading technology. Even though civilian mages could learn these from school, they simply couldn’t compare in terms of hardware.</p><p>Star Dust Artifacts, to put it more formally, could nourish the soul and cultivation, allowing cultivators to quickly alleviate fatigue caused by meditation and continue their practice. In simpler terms, they were coolants, reducing the cooldown time after meditation.</p><p>There was no way around it; since Mo Fan wasn’t a player with real money, he naturally had to obtain the necessary cultivation resources through school.</p><p>The competition at school was intense, akin to sifting through sand to find gold!</p><p>Fortunately, this time they secured the first position, so they shouldn’t lack magical resources from the school. They could practice in peace of mind.</p><p>"We will allocate the usage time of the Stardust Magic Artifacts based on your annual performance rankings, with higher ranks allowing for longer usage times. Of course, our school is very humane; every quarter, we conduct tests and re-rank students, which means the distribution of Stardust Magic Artifacts will change accordingly... It's worth noting that although you are currently top-tier students with advantages over regular class students, don't think you can be complacent for the next two years. In quarterly assessments, the bottom 10 in your class will be demoted to regular classes, while the top 10 from regular classes will be promoted to top-tier classes, so the competition pressure is even greater!" said Xue Mushi.</p><p>This system has little difference from the scientific world; Mo Fan didn't feel particularly strongly about it.</p><p>Many people dislike school and hate college entrance exams, but there's a saying that rings true: without schools or college entrance exams, how would you compete against second-generation wealthy elites?</p><p>The resources of the school might not be inferior to those large aristocratic families; the difference lies in the fact that schools are places where only the best survive.</p><p>It also echoes the saying: gold will eventually shine!</p><p>...</p><p>"Mo Fan, as the top student in your class, you should have been the first to receive the Stardust Magic Artifact and use it for the longest time. However, due to your disrespectful behavior during the annual assessment, your usage time will be reduced from one month to ten days. This is a punishment for you!" said Xue Mushi sternly.</p><p>"Oh, one month becomes ten days; that's too high a price. If I had just held back then, those ten extra days would have given me a significant advantage," some students started discussing.</p><p>"If he had simply bowed his head and agreed to join the Mu family, he might have received even more!"</p><p>"You're right, why be so principled."</p><p>Xue Mushi glared at the students to make them quiet.</p><p>"Do you have any objections to this punishment, Mo Fan?" Xue Mushi asked.</p><p>"No," Mo Fan replied.</p><p>Mo Fan really needed the Stardust Magic Artifact; his cultivation time was already longer than others', and with the artifact, it would be even more efficient.</p><p>However, while it would indeed be highly beneficial in the long run, holding it for just a month wouldn't offer him much advantage.</p><p>"Tea Boy, I have a question for you," Mo Fan approached Mu Bai's table and said seriously.</p><p>"What the hell are you calling me?" Mu Bai's temper flared up immediately.</p><p>"Alright, Mu Bai, I have a question for you."</p>
