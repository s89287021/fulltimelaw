						<p>"Everyone, follow me! Wind users, go to the front and scout ahead!" Xue Mushi quickly shouted.</p><p>Students by the window scrambled into the hallway, but a large group of students from other classes were also crowding in, screaming wildly and losing their minds.</p><p>Screams, cries, and teachers' shouts echoed throughout the hallway, completely out of control.</p><p>Mo Fan was still standing in the classroom, staring at these terrified students. A sense of sorrow flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Like a herd of wild elk, once one elk is frightened by a wolf, it will start running, and when the other elks see this, they will follow suit in panic. In fact, there was only one wolf; if the elks were to band together and raise their antlers, even more wolves might not be their match.</p><p>This fear can spread, just as it does in Mo Fan's original world. Otherwise, why are there always so many horrifying trampling incidents?</p><p>A large portion of the people in the classroom were frightened away. At that moment, all the skills they had learned in class were completely forgotten!</p><p>A chant echoed in the classroom. Mo Fan turned around and saw Xu Zhaoting angrily take action. Violent thunderbolt seals emerged from the air.</p><p>These purple lightning seals frenziedly whipped at the one-eyed demon wolf under Xu Zhaoting's command. Although accuracy was lacking, many of the seals hit the one-eyed demon wolf.</p><p>"Hmph, even one one-eyed demon wolf can turn them into that cowardly state, typical scoundrels!" Xu Zhaoting disdainfully glanced at those fleeing in panic.</p><p>"Right, with so many of us, why should we be afraid of a few one-eyed demon wolves?" Wang Sanpang also stood up.</p><p>No sooner had he finished speaking when Wang Sanpang completed his Earth Wave Technique in just 3 seconds.</p><p>He slammed his obese hands into the classroom floor, and an instant later, a wave of rock undulations spread from the classroom to the cement playground. The one-eyed demon wolf, whose muscles were paralyzed, was violently smashed into another basketball hoop by the rapid transmission of the earth wave.</p><p>Zhou Min did have some courage; she quickly completed her Fire Star Track, adding a ball of flame to her hand.</p><p>When the one-eyed werewolf had no chance to get up, Zhou Min's Fire Zhi already sliced through the flagpole of the teaching building and accurately hit the one-eyed werewolf trapped under the basketball hoop!</p><p>Fire Zhi, with its bone-burning power, was naturally formidable. It instantly reduced the basketball hoop to ashes, while the one-eyed werewolf howled in pain under the flames, rolling recklessly on the playground.</p><p>Soon, several magic attacks of different elements descended from various positions. Judging by the skill levels, they were clearly released by some practical course teachers. Working together, they quickly turned the frenzied one-eyed werewolf into a charred corpse!</p><p>Seeing the one-eyed werewolf swiftly eliminated, Mo Fan breathed a slight sigh of relief; it seemed that not all students in the school were useless.</p><p>"You guys follow me," Xue Mushing said to the relatively calm students who remained in the classroom.</p><p>Xu Zhao Ting, Zhao Kun San, Mu Bai, and Zhou Min had already dared to face demons head-on during their initial training. A year later, their fear of demons was far less intense than before.</p><p>The group followed him but wondered why Xue Mushing suddenly left them behind.</p><p>"This task should have been handled by a teacher, but a large number of one-eyed werewolves appeared in the backyard, and our teachers' combat abilities are also quite limited. At present, we must rely on your strength as students," Xue Mushing said with an unusual level of seriousness.</p><p>"Teacher, it's not the time to waste any more time; please get straight to the point," Wang Sanpang couldn't help but say.</p><p>"We need a vanguard team. This vanguard team will likely be mostly composed of students."</p><p>"The vanguard team will operate almost independently and lead the way for the entire group."</p><p>"Our school's nearly two thousand people will follow the clear path opened by the vanguard team. Among all the students, you are the strongest in combat skills, not inferior to any teacher. Therefore, I hope you can form a leading vanguard team that guides everyone towards the safety barrier," Xue Mushing explained.</p><p>After he finished speaking, the students fell silent, unable to make up their minds.</p><p>In fact, they were also uncertain whether they could withstand demons after separating from the main group. Having them serve as the vanguard team indeed carried too many risks.</p><p>"This decision is up to you; I won't force it on anyone. If you're unwilling, I'll find other students, but every moment of delay increases the danger... The vanguard team will be led by me. Please give me your answers as quickly as possible, okay?" Xue Mushing said.</p><p>"Teacher Xue, I join," Zhou Min almost showed no hesitation and was the first to join the vanguard team.</p><p>"I will join as well." Xu Zhao Ting did not think too much about it.</p><p>Wang Sanpang and Xu Zhao Ting were best friends. Since Xu Zhao Ting had joined, Wang Sanpang could only force a smile and join in.</p><p>Xue Mushi nodded slightly. With a lightning mage on their team, the combat power of this small squad would be elevated to another level, and they should be able to reach the safety barrier smoothly.</p><p>"I will join as well."</p><p>Mu Bai and his sycophant Zhao Kunsan exchanged glances before also deciding to join.</p><p>Then, a very talented earth mage student joined in.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou, however, kept his gaze on Mo Fan, making it clear that he was indecisive.</p><p>"Fan, are we joining the main force or the vanguard?" Zhang Xiaohou asked.</p><p>"We will join as well." Mo Fan replied.</p><p>"I did not expect Fan to be such a righteous person," Zhang Xiaohou could find humor even in tough situations and managed to smile despite himself.</p><p>"Following the main force is more dangerous," Mo Fan said coolly.</p><p>"Why?" Zhang Xiaohou was puzzled.</p><p>The main force had at least 1,700 people. With such a large number, they should not be in any danger even if attacked by a group of demons. After all, almost everyone among these 1,700 were mages.</p><p>"You saw earlier; just one one-eyed wolf demon caused the entire floor to panic. This is an instinct of the weak—fear spreads and amplifies endlessly. Therefore, the combat capability of the main force is actually quite limited. Without any surprise, just 100 demons would be enough to wipe out the entire main force. A large group moving forward attracts not only demon swarms but even higher-level demons. I do not want to be among a flock of sheep; at that point, your life and death are no longer in your own hands," Mo Fan whispered into Zhang Xiaohou's ear.</p><p>"I will join as well."
