						<p>Night was approaching, and the entire city of Bocheng was still shrouded in a gray twilight.</p><p>Usually, by this time, Bocheng would be ablaze with lights, but now, apart from the faint drizzle veiling the darkness, only a continuous roar could be heard coming from somewhere, making one wonder whether this place was truly a human settlement or a demon hunting ground?</p><p>In Wenming City District, where almost no one had evacuated, corpses littered the ground, and every second, someone would be dragged out to become food in their stomachs.</p><p>At this very moment, as the sun set its last dim glow on the city, hordes of demons rampaged through the streets. They were furious because a group of damned humans had destroyed their vital passage!!</p><p>They still had so many subjects and companions who had never tasted such delicious human flesh, and they had yet to fully conquer this place when the passage was destroyed...</p><p>The nearby demons grew enraged and furiously pursued the humans who had destroyed the passage, even if those humans included a mid-level mage. They would not back down.</p><p>That powerful human had already been killed by them, leaving only four scurrying figures like rats. It didn’t matter; they would never escape alive.</p><p>...</p><p>"Luoyunbo, forget it. We can't run anymore," Pan Lijun said with a heart-wrenching expression as she watched Luoyunbo exert all his strength to flee.</p><p>Originally, the moment she joined this task force, she had accepted that she might not return.</p><p>The cave entrance was destroyed, and Captain Cheng sacrificed himself. How could these novice mages escape the demons' pursuit?</p><p>"Stop saying such foolishness. Their speed can't match mine. Believe me; we can definitely get away!" Luoyunbo cursed.</p><p>Luoyunbo didn’t give up. No military mage truly faced death unflinchingly, but they were more resolute than ordinary people and would not hesitate when sacrifice was required.</p><p>The mission was complete, and Captain Cheng had used his last magical energy to carve out a blood path for them, hoping that under the face of certain death, they would never give up.</p><p>Was life truly precious? Too many lives had been lost in this Bocheng. Having grown up here since childhood, Luoyunbo did not wish to see any more deaths and especially did not want his teammate Pan Lijun to fall into the demons' hands.</p><p>In short, he wouldn’t give up; he wanted to live. He wanted to see Shanka Team Leader and company return victorious with Yicao Lang’s head. He wanted to see all demons driven out of Bocheng and the city swiftly recover its peaceful days after the disaster, free from screams and cries...</p><p>Luo Yunbo did not want to die, and he also did not allow Pan Lijun to give up like this!</p><p>"Ugh wuh wuh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Suddenly, at the crossroads ahead, six one-eyed magic wolves abruptly stood in front of Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun's escape route.</p><p>There were no other alleys on this long street. The number of demons chasing them from behind was at least over a hundred, far beyond what the insignificant pair could block. Even the six one-eyed magic wolves appearing ahead left them with no chance of survival.</p><p>Pan Lijun showed a hint of resignation on her face. She truly did not want to make meaningless struggles anymore. After all, he was already dead; what meaning was there for her to live alone in this world.</p><p>Even if the number of demons reached over a hundred, as long as they were behind him and there were no general-class demons, they would never catch up to him.</p><p>Once they crossed this long street, they would have a chance at survival. Yet, here appeared six wandering demons, clearly blocking them in response to their companions' calls.</p><p>How unwilling he was! If only he had been stronger, the outcome would have been completely different.</p><p>Luo Yunbo scanned his surroundings, hoping to find any trace of a possibility for survival. However, there was nothing, except for the flame-like glow on the rooftop of a building not far away...</p><p>...</p><p>"Burn!"</p><p>If a streak of fire cut through the night like a meteor, dazzling and filled with a destructive aura, it must be my great Mo Fan's Flame Fist!!!</p><p>Flame Fist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Daytime seemed to merge perfectly into nighttime at this moment. On the balcony of a certain building, scorching flames illuminated this vast dark district.</p><p>The air temperature had reached its peak of heat. With Mo Fan's wild and fierce swing, the blazing inferno punch that pierced through the night seemed to embody the force battling against the Night God.</p><p>Surrounded by a blinding light, the massive flaming fist transformed into a searing meteor. It roared majestically past several apartment buildings, heading straight for the intersection of the long street!!!</p><p>"Boom!!! Boom!!! Boom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>"This..." Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun were stunned.</p><p>It was as if they had been favored by a god; just when they were about to face death, a flaming fist blasted the gates of hell to pieces. How could such feelings be described in words?</p><p>Luo Yunbo reacted quickly and used Wind Track to pull Pan Lijun away. As they passed by the enormous crater, Luo Yunbo couldn't help but turn his head to look at the platform that had just flashed with flames...</p><p>That flaming figure...</p><p>Why was it so familiar? Why did it seem like Mo Fan was searching for his relatives?</p><p>Had he seen wrongly?</p><p>Pan Lijun also turned her head as she fled. She never thought a miracle would occur right before death, and this miracle came from the mysterious man on the balcony!!</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>Were there still unknown experts in Bofu City? Why did he choose to save them?</p><p>...</p><p>As the flames gradually faded, the district once again plunged into darkness.</p><p>On the terrace, Xinxia stood quietly there. The graceful figure of the young girl slowly swayed in the aftermath of the heatwave that had just swept through, blending with her black hair to create a beautiful and touching scene on the terrace.</p><p>However, her exquisite and beautiful face was completely filled with astonishment.</p><p>Her beautiful eyes were fixed on the silhouette standing at the edge of the rooftop. Even though she knew he had advanced into the intermediate realm of mages, when he was engulfed in flames and wildly unleashed blazing punches that pierced through the night, Xinxia felt his entire demeanor transform along with the tyrannical fire.</p><p>Mo Fan always felt warm and mischievous to Xinxia. He would secretly share all his devious plans with her. It was hard to imagine that such absolute power in his hands would be so solemn and grave!</p><p>"Isn't it cool?" Mo Fan turned around, noticing that Xinxia's beautiful eyes had not moved from his face. Unconsciously, he asked in admiration.</p><p>Xinxia only then realized she had been staring at him with a dazed look. Her cheeks flushed red, almost reaching her ears. She shifted her gaze away and no longer dared to meet Mo Fan's eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Xinxia finally understood what it felt like for one's heart to race like that of a wild deer, as mentioned in many books.</p><p>…</p><p>Doing life, the most important thing is to be happy.</p><p>As an author, the most important thing is to get votes. With votes comes happiness!</p><p>As a reader, believe this and vote decisively!</p>
