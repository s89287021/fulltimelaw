						<p>The chief instructor also gave a bitter smile: "That frenzied summoning beast was killed by Mo Fan."</p><p>Xue Museng, Zhang Jianguo, Luo Yunbo, Pan Lijun, Bai Yang, and other instructors and teachers' mouths suddenly formed an O!</p><p>The most intense reaction came from Summoner Bai Yang. He looked at this student who was merely in Grade 12, his jaw almost hitting the ground!!</p><p>"My Shadow Wolf Beast... did you kill it??" Bai Yang asked incredulously.</p><p>"Mm-hmm!" Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>For a moment, Bai Yang's expression became extremely bizarre. It could be certain that this summoner's mind must have collapsed at that moment!</p><p>A mighty Shadow Wolf Beast was single-handedly killed by a student who had only just started their practical training!!</p><p>Damn it, if he knew the outcome would be like this, Bai Yang would rather believe his Shadow Wolf Beast had died stupidly from colliding with a rock, too humiliating for the beast!!</p><p>Instructor Bai Yang was completely shell-shocked. It's likely that even writing a pile of papers at that moment wouldn't calm him down.</p><p>It was such a blow!</p><p>He had never encountered such a devastating thing in his life!</p><p>Considering that their team had spent two months, using countless resources and manpower to finally tame this Shadow Wolf Beast, only to have it killed by a Grade 12 student... how could they as instructors bear to face such a situation!!</p><p>The students were all rendered speechless.</p><p>They knew perfectly well just how monstrous the Shadow Wolf Beast was; it had been a one-sided slaughter against them...</p><p>And Mo Fan, also a Grade 12 student, had killed the Shadow Wolf Beast single-handedly!!</p><p>They were bowled over!!</p><p>"Truly, I am bowled over!!"</p><p>"Moreover, I have some good news to share with you all. Since Mo Fan has completed the impossible bounty, all of you star students in this class will receive an A for your training!" the chief instructor said dramatically to all the students.</p><p>"Really... really??" </p><p>"If I get an A, I'm definitely going to get into a great magic university!!"</p><p>"Mo Fan, you are my second parents! The only way to repay you is with soap!"</p><p>"Do you have a girlfriend, Mo Fan??" one of the girls who had been saved asked softly, blushing.</p><p>"Do you need a boyfriend, Mo Fan?"</p><p>In an instant, Mo Fan became everyone's hero.</p><p>After all, not only did he save their lives, but he also helped everyone get the most important A-grade training score!</p><p>Zhao Kun was about to say some biting remarks as usual, but he was immediately surrounded by menacing glares from those around him, causing him to swallow his words.</p><p>Mu Bai's expression remained extremely ugly.</p><p>He had been the first to release magic, yet it had been completely useless, and he had been stunned by the dark wolf beast. In the end, Mo Fan stole all the glory!</p><p>......</p><p>......</p><p>"Sigh, did you hear? The bounty was completed by a student. It seems that Bai Yang's dark wolf beast was directly killed by that student!"</p><p>"Don't just spread rumors, we all know how formidable dark wolf beasts are. If a student could complete it, I would eat the bounty screen raw," said a towering hunter squad leader.</p><p>"Then go eat," Pan Li Jun scanned the tall man and said coldly.</p><p>"Go check for yourselves, the bounty is already completed!"</p><p>The veterans at the station looked up and indeed saw that the bounty was marked as "Completed," with "Tianlan Magic High School Grade 2 Student - Mo Fan!" noted below it.</p><p>"What the heck, what the heck! This kid has huge balls!"</p><p>This news stunned all the veterans at the station!</p><p>The man who had wanted to eat the LCD screen looked even more miserable.</p><p>Damn, could it be that a student actually completed the bounty that they themselves might not have been able to complete??</p><p>Soon, this news spread throughout the station.</p><p>Apart from the military mages of Bog City, most of the people at the station were wandering hunters who made their living by taking bounties and hunting demons. However, with this news spreading, each of these veterans felt ashamed. It was they who had mocked the students the loudest in the beginning.</p><p>"What about the magic gear... defensive magic gear?" The peddler Er Daku hurriedly asked.</p><p>"Captain Shanzhong is also worried now; he didn't prepare any magic gear because everyone knew that a student couldn't possibly complete it. Captain Shanzhong is someone who keeps his word, so he should have bought and sent a defensive magic gear to that student at his own expense," Pan Li Jun said.</p><p>"That student made huge profits! Captain Shanzhong's heart must be bleeding!"</p><p>"We veterans who risk our lives might not even get a defensive magic gear... sigh!"</p><p>"By the way, could it be that this kid is from some super prominent family? He's wearing such expensive clothes, how else would he withstand demons?"</p><p>"Mao Dan, he's just an ordinary student. I heard his father is only a driver who supplies materials to our station."</p><p>"Well then... what the hell kind of freak is he! "</p><p>"We always deal with demons in a team."</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the stone house, the head instructor Zhan Kong was holding a box in his hand, wearing an expression of pain.</p><p>"Damn it, these heartless merchants! They priced my scythe shield at 550,000, they must be kidding!!" Zhan Kong cursed loudly.</p><p>Lu Yunbo, Pan Lijun, and Bai Yang on the side did not say a word.</p><p>The scythe shield was truly an expensive item. Zhan Kong had no idea how much salary he had spent on it. This reward was something he promised himself, the government would definitely not reimburse!</p><p>"Go fetch that brat over here, hm!" Zhan Kong said unhappily.</p><p>"Big brother, I've been right here all along," Mo Fan raised his hand and said to the somewhat confused head instructor Zhan Kong.</p><p>Seeing Mo Fan again, Zhan Kong was even more furious, and he could not understand at all how he had managed to kill the shadow wolf beast!</p><p>"Take it, take it." Zhan Kong handed the scythe shield over to Mo Fan.</p><p>"Instructor, can you let go?" Mo Fan said.</p><p>The corners of Zhan Kong's mouth twitched, but he finally let go.</p><p>Mo Fan grabbed this treasure, and his whole body was filled with joy.</p><p>This time facing the demons head-on made Mo Fan realize something: having offensive capabilities alone is not enough; any mage who only knows how to attack will be killed instantly by a demon's strike.</p><p>If there were a defensive magic item, before he learned defensive spells, this would truly be a lifesaver!</p><p>"Boy, if you can't find a suitable job after graduation, come report to me," Zhankong said offhandedly.</p><p>Despite having a thousand regrets in his heart, Zhankong could not help but admire the young man's courage and wit.</p><p>Many mages lost their lives in battles against demons largely due to mental set patterns; they failed to understand how to make good use of their limited magical skills.</p><p>Indeed, at the novice mage level, all mages only possess one skill, yet there are many ways to utilize that single skill. This boy seemed to have grasped many truths that even veteran mages might not have mastered early on.</p>
