						<p>"The next..."</p><p>"The next..."</p><p>"The next..."</p><p>"Zhang Hou!"</p><p>Standing not too far from Mo Fan, the mud monkey Zhang Hou turned and gave Mo Fan a glance, saying, "Brother Mo Fan, I'm going over."</p><p>"Good luck."</p><p>"Humph, wish you were water-type too," Zhao Kun said with a taunt.</p><p>Zhang Hou was just a skinny monkey; as he placed his hand on the Awakening Stone, an odd whirlwind appeared on it almost immediately, causing Teacher Luo's robe to flutter slightly.</p><p>"Well done, wind-type, quite a talent. Make sure to train hard and don't slack off!" Xue Mushi also showed satisfaction.</p><p>Class teacher Xue Mushi was very pleased because within just ten or so numbers, two students with excellent talents had appeared in his class. If they worked hard, they could certainly get into good universities.</p><p>Of course, the biggest treasure he found was student number 1, Mu Bai, with exceptional ice-type talent and backing from an ice-type noble family—definitely a future pillar of society!</p><p>It seemed that this year's Class 8 would have a chance to be among the top.</p><p>"The next..."</p><p>"The next..."</p><p>"The next..."</p><p>"Puh~~~~~"</p><p>On the Awakening Stone, a sudden orange flame leaped up.</p><p>This scene made everyone in the class widen their eyes instantly.</p><p>"Fire... Fire Element!!!"</p><p>"Dang it, it's actually a girl. What's this girl's name?"</p><p>For a moment, the girl who awakened became the center of attention for the entire class. The Fire Element was one of the most dazzling elements and the top choice for all Mage-level mages if they could choose...</p><p>Unfortunately, the Fire Element was quite stubborn, with a low probability, usually not exceeding 3 in a whole class, less than a tenth.</p><p>"Her name is Zhou Min. She seems to be the daughter of one of our teachers," someone whispered.</p><p>"She's quite pretty. We should go and get to know her."</p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p>"It seems like she follows in her mother's footsteps. Teacher Wen Hua would probably be very pleased if she knew," said Mr. Xue Musheng, the class monitor.</p><p>"Thank you, teacher."</p><p>"The next one... Wind Element"</p><p>"The next one... Light Element"</p><p>"Teacher, I'm going to the rooftop. Don't pull me back," said the student with the Light Element.</p><p>"The next one... Water Element."</p><p>"Ou-guang classmate, wait for me; I will go to the rooftop with you."</p><p>"The next one..."</p><p>...</p><p>Finally, almost all of the classmates in his faculty awakened. Mo Fan held No. 48 student ID card, his heart beating wildly. Perhaps no one was as nervous as he was. On the one hand, it had only been three months since he had started learning magic; on the other hand, he genuinely feared that he might fail to awaken!</p><p>"No. 48, Mo Fan!"</p><p>"It's your turn!" Zhang Hou turned around and encouraged him.</p><p>"You came in by selling pots and pans, so don't hold any hopes. With good luck, you might become a Water faculty or Ou-guang faculty member, but if you can't reach the Intermediate Mage level in cultivation, it'll be useless. If you're unlucky, you'll fail to awaken, ah ha ha, losing everything," Zhao Kun San said with cold remarks.</p><p>"Can you shut your dog mouth?" Zhang Hou said somewhat angrily.</p><p>In Zhang Hou's heart, Mo Fan was his big brother. Although his magic grades were terrible and he had found another way into the Magic High School this time, he absolutely did not want to see Mo Fan awaken worse than others.</p><p>Nine-year compulsory magic education was actually laying the foundation for awakening as well as various theories for cultivation afterward, so that one would not be at a loss during cultivation. If they didn't learn well, on the one hand, awakening would fail; on the other hand, cultivation would stop advancing.</p><p>Mo Fan took a step forward and walked through the crowd.</p><p>"That's him, he probably got in via backdoor channels."</p><p>"Who is this? He looks pretty handsome," a cute little girl asked.</p><p>"He's a very trashy student. I used to be in his neighboring class," another girl with a mushroom head said with her mouth wide open.</p><p>"Oh, that means his awakening ability might be quite poor."</p><p>"It's even questionable if he can awaken successfully."</p><p>"I said, those in the Holy Light and Ling Shui schools of magic, don't lose heart. Just wait and see Mo Fan's awakening; you'll be relieved. This guy scored single digits on his exams, with a terribly poor foundation. His awakening is likely to fail." At this point, Zhao Kun San and Zhang Hou got furious and started mocking him loudly.</p><p>When he said that, those in the Holy Light and Ling Shui schools of magic really did pay close attention. If someone's unusual awakening failed, that would be too relieving...</p><p>"Don't make a racket!" Xue Mu Sheng glared at Zhao Kun San, who had caused trouble.</p><p>Mu Bai's lips curled slightly; he wanted Mo Fan to embarrass himself in public. This guy was nothing but trash and had no right to get close to Miss Mu Ning Xue. Mu Bai was so handsome, with incredible magical talent and tremendous effort. Mu Ning Xue should be very close to him.</p><p>"Trash, I heard your family even sold their house to support you for your awakening. If you fail, just jump into a river and end it all; don't bring shame to your family," Mu Bai whispered as Mo Fan passed by.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at Mu Bai and held back from impulsively cursing the fool. He walked up to Teacher Xue Mu Sheng.</p><p>"Mo Fan, place your hand here," Xue Mu Sheng said calmly.</p><p>As homeroom teacher, Xue Mu Sheng actually understood this student's situation quite well...</p><p>The magic mid-term exam results were basically at the bottom. Due to instructions from above, he had entered Tian Lan Magic High School. According to Xue Mu Sheng, Mo Fan came from an ordinary family with no background or talent and poor grades that he dared not look at. Having such a student in his class was quite troublesome and could easily lower the overall evaluation of the entire class.</p><p>Sigh, there was nothing to be done; consider it bad luck for himself. Hopefully, this kid wouldn't really fail his awakening; otherwise, he would truly become a laughingstock across the entire grade.</p><p>Mo Fan's hand kept trembling, still somewhat nervous.</p><p>"Stay steady, don't shake," Xue Mu Sheng reminded him.</p><p>Mo Fan grabbed his right hand with his left and successfully placed his palm on the awakening stone.</p><p>It was very cold; perhaps it was because the previous person awakened an Ice school ability. The entire awakening process felt icy...</p><p>Hmm, something's not right; why is it starting to tingle and feel hot?</p><p>"Close your eyes and sense your spiritual world!" Homeroom teacher Xue Mu Sheng said.</p><p>He was truly a problematic student, not even knowing this basic procedure.</p><p>Mo Fan hurriedly followed the instructions, closing his eyes.</p><p>When people enter their so-called spiritual world by closing their eyes, their minds will appear void. Normal individuals will constantly imagine within that void, visualizing vague scenes like movie clips. When one completely empties their mind, thinking of nothing, the mind is a void, akin to a starless night sky.</p><p>There was nothing in this spiritual world, but when Mo Fan placed his hand on the Awakening Stone, he could feel a surge of power...</p><p>This power transmitted from his palm throughout his body and suddenly, like possessing some kind of magical force, it drew a brilliant purple arc across the void in his spiritual world, breathtaking and soul-shaking!!</p>
