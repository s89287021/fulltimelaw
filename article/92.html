						<p>Within the Sacred Spring, a young man still sat seriously in place, occasionally showing signs of excitement or frowning intensely. Whether it was studying or cultivating, these were long and tedious tasks, which Mo Fan had deeply experienced. However, for his ambitious wizard life, he was willing to endure these years.</p><p>"I wonder how many days have passed, but I feel that I am about to reach the threshold of a higher realm!" Mo Fan exited his meditation and began to reflect on himself.</p><p>Meditation was ultimately the greatest catalyst for stardust. Mo Fan could clearly feel the changes in his magical stardust during these days. Originally, a higher-level magical star cloud had been a strange and intriguing thing to him. However, as his stardust emitted light pulses of varying intensity, Mo Fan sensed that this might be a sign of breakthrough.</p><p>Lightning was Mo Fan's first awakened element. During this time, he felt the lightning stardust's desire to break free and grow, even noting changes in those starlets...</p><p>"Hum~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Suddenly, intense tremors came from all directions. Mo Fan, who had been about to push through his breakthrough, immediately opened his eyes and surveyed the shaking walls around him.</p><p>What's going on? An earthquake?</p><p>Mo Fan stood up and walked to the position of the main door, pressing his ear against it to listen for any news from outside.</p><p>Just as he was about to hear something, the door, which had been subjected to special restrictions, slowly opened.</p><p>"A week has passed? So quickly!" Mo Fan said in surprise.</p><p>As the door opened, what caught Mo Fan's eye was a woman in a light white uniform rushing inside. At the same time, he noticed that the entire hall was covered with fresh red bloodstains!</p><p>The guards lay scattered around, their bodies torn into several pieces, mixed with clumps of blood and internal organs, leaving Mo Fan stunned to the point of immobility!!</p><p>Bodies, so many bodies!</p><p>What happened to these Guardians of the Sacred Spring? Why were they in such a miserable state??</p><p>"Liang Wei Zhang!!" The woman in the white uniform shouted.</p><p>No sooner had she finished speaking than Mo Fan saw Liang Wei Zhang, the mid-level mage, being thrown towards one of the pillars like a punching bag, causing the pillar to break in half at the waist.</p><p>Fortunately, Liang Wei Zhang still had a layer of water-based aura protecting him; otherwise, with that impact force, he would have surely been injured severely.</p><p>What on earth happened??</p><p>Mo Fan was terrified. Something could throw a full-fledged mid-level mage around like a punching bag!</p><p>Mo Fan stepped aside and finally saw the other half of the hall blocked by a stone door, where to his shock stood a monster comparable in size to a small truck!</p><p>The monster's neck and head were indistinguishable, but its rat-like body was unmistakable. Unlike the giant-eyed rats Mo Fan had seen before, this creature was covered with an incredibly fierce blood pattern, winding and dense, making the car-sized giant rat even more terrifying!</p><p>Mo Fan had been in the Demon Hunting Team for a year but had never seen such a size or a giant-eyed rat covered in blood patterns. The aura it exuded made him feel as if he had fallen into an ice cave, shivering with cold!!</p><p>"This... This is a Blood Patterned Golem Rat!!" Mo Fan searched through all the knowledge from his Demonology class and finally found the name of this monster.</p><p>Oh my God, the blood-patterned troll rat in the textbook still looked somewhat comical, didn't it? But the real blood-patterned troll rat was such a terrifying sight that it was a shock to the eyes!</p><p>Why would something like this appear in the grand hall? Were those guards killed by this blood-patterned troll rat?</p><p>"Gugugugu!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The blood-patterned troll rat seemed to have smelled the aura emitted by the Sacred Spring on the ground, and its massive lantern-like eyes immediately locked onto Mo Fan and the female guard's positions.</p><p>Its sharp claws effortlessly sank into the stone bricks of the grand hall. One could sense that the blood-patterned troll rat was gathering strength, like a roaring truck engine.</p><p>"Close the door!!" Liang Wei Chang shouted at the female guard from amidst the pile of debris.</p><p>Lin Yuxin's lips were bitten through, but she had no choice but to forcefully hit the sealed door!</p><p>The two sides of the restricted gates abruptly closed. At that moment, Mo Fan shuddered as he saw the blood-patterned troll rat's claws reaching inside, causing him to instinctively take a few steps back.</p><p>It was too fast!!!</p><p>The closing speed of the restricted gate was extremely fast; despite being thirty to forty meters away, it seemed to rush over in a blink of an eye.</p><p>"Boom!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The stone door trembled violently. Clearly, the blood-patterned troll rat had collided with it.</p><p>Lin Yuxin's face turned pale as she glanced at the student still meditating inside...</p><p>"What happened?" Mo Fan asked, still shaken from the incident.</p><p>That scene was too terrifying; if the door had closed just one step later, they would have been instantaneously killed. This blood-patterned troll rat was several times more fearsome than that half-advanced one-eyed demon wolf and was not something an entry-level mage could withstand.</p><p>"If you don't want to die here, follow me!" Lin Yuxin had no patience to explain this to a student.</p><p>On the surface, all the mages were defending against the demon invasion. The Earth Holy Spring area was even subjected to a sudden ambush by the demons. Under these circumstances, it would be impossible to receive any reinforcements, and they could only rely on themselves to protect this Earth Holy Spring.</p>
