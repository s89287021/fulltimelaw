						<p>"That uncle, won't he be okay? He went into the mountains?" Mo Fan said.</p><p>"My dad went too?" Mo Fan's face changed abruptly.</p><p>"Yes, they say the other side offered a high price. These two people, jobs that even mage apprentices wouldn't dare to take on, they, as ordinary folks... if nothing happens, it's fine, but if something does happen, what are we supposed to do?" Mo Qing said.</p><p>"Still, I wish they would just do some procurement in the city. I can't help but worry about them leaving the city," Mo Qing muttered again.</p><p>After hearing Mo Qing's complaints, Mo Fan still felt somewhat uneasy inside.</p><p>In the past six months, his dad Mo Jiating hadn't come to school to visit him at all. It turned out he had found another way, delivering supplies to the stations for mages patrolling and hunting outside the city. Compared to his previous job doing logistics procurement for the wealthy, this task was indeed more dangerous.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan didn't rest during one entire winter vacation. After staying a few days at Auntie's place, Mo Fan returned to the Tianlan Magic High School library.</p><p>There were so many things in the library that he needed to learn, such as the Black Cathedral, which he had overlooked.</p><p>After some investigation, Mo Fan finally understood what the Black Cathedral was all about.</p><p>In the past month, Mo Fan had been focusing on meditation.</p><p>After realizing that the lightning essence only faded after releasing two lightning seals, Mo Fan understood the importance of meditation even more.</p><p>So for this entire month, despite the temptation to use the Fire Essence - Fiery Vitality skill, Mo Fan didn't easily interact with the fire essence; he needed to build a solid foundation first.</p><p>When fully focused on meditation and treating it as a daily routine, time flies by swiftly.</p><p>It's already the start of the new school term.</p><p>In the library, Mo Fan swept away the cobwebs all over his body, preparing to welcome a new magical semester.</p><p>With great enthusiasm, he walked into the classroom and took his usual seat in the back row.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Something seems off today.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at Zhang Xiaohou next to him and noticed that this guy looked rather out of sorts.</p><p>Usually, this fellow's gaze was as curious as that of a little monkey, lively and always eager to spill out what he had learned over the past few days before class began.</p><p>But today, his eyes were vacant, his mouth slightly agape, staring ahead with an inexplicably dazed expression.</p><p>Looking around, Xu Qinglin and Lu Xiaobin, two weak students, also seemed similarly affected, as if they had been... possessed!</p><p>Damnit, could it be true that what Aunt Mo Qing said was right—there's a malevolent swamp demon lurking in the city, and all these guys have fallen victim to it?!!</p><p>Having grown accustomed to the hoarse and slow-paced voice of Old Man Lian, hearing this fresh, enchanting voice filled with charm and sensuality suddenly woke Mo Fan up from his drowsiness!</p><p>He lifted his head to find the source of the sound, and his gaze and expression were instantly entranced!</p><p>What the hell, what malevolent swamp demon could bewitch people's hearts? Clearly, all the hormonally charged boys in the class had their souls stolen by this new beauty teacher.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue was wearing a classic black suit set. The white blouse beneath her black blazer rose up into a majestic and beautiful mountain, almost spilling out, making Mo Fan doubt whether that tiny button could contain such an overwhelming presence; it felt like a little boy trying to block the whole courtyard of spring blossoms with his back, yet struggling to hold them in!</p><p>Now, let's move on to the next stage where the senior proofreading editor will take over.</p><p>When fully focused on meditation and treating it as a daily routine, time flies by swiftly.</p><p>It’s already the start of the new school term.</p><p>In the library, Mo Fan swept away the cobwebs all over his body, preparing for a new magical semester.</p><p>With great enthusiasm, he walked into the classroom and took his usual seat in the back row.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Something seems off today.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at Zhang Xiaohou next to him and noticed that this guy looked rather out of sorts.</p><p>Usually, this fellow's gaze was as curious as that of a little monkey, lively and always eager to spill out what he had learned over the past few days before class began.</p><p>But today, his eyes were vacant, his mouth slightly agape, staring ahead with an inexplicably dazed expression.</p><p>Looking around, Xu Qinglin and Lu Xiaobin, two weak students, also seemed similarly affected, as if they had been... possessed!</p><p>Damnit, could it be true that what Aunt Mo Qing said was right—there's a malevolent swamp demon lurking in the city, and all these guys have fallen victim to it?!!</p><p>Having grown accustomed to the hoarse and slow-paced voice of Old Man Lian, hearing this fresh, enchanting voice filled with charm and sensuality suddenly woke Mo Fan up from his drowsiness!</p><p>He lifted his head to find the source of the sound, and his gaze and expression were instantly entranced!</p><p>What the hell, what malevolent swamp demon could bewitch people's hearts?

Clearly, all the hormonally charged boys in the class had their souls stolen by this new beauty teacher.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue was wearing a classic black suit set. The white blouse beneath her black blazer rose up into a majestic and beautiful mountain, almost spilling out, making Mo Fan doubt whether that tiny button could contain such an overwhelming presence; it felt like a little boy trying to block the whole courtyard of spring blossoms with his back, yet struggling to hold them in!</p><p>Deadly, really deadly.</p><p>In the early morning, this was already the most ferocious time for boys. Stimulated like this, it’s estimated that most would look ridiculous.</p><p>"Given that everyone has only been awake for half a year and none of you can cast magic yet, I hope you understand that mastering powerful forces does not mean you can use them well. Failing to control your powers could even backfire," Teacher Tang Yue quickly entered her lecture mode.</p><p>Her originally serious attitude had brought many top students back to their senses. Who knew that when she turned around and wrote a few key points on the blackboard, blood spurted from everyone's noses in the classroom.</p><p>Cough cough!</p><p>In such a sacred academy, how could one think about lewd things? Anyway, Mo Fan was focused on his studies, fundamentally different from these ordinary people whose thoughts were dominated by their lower bodies. In summary, next time he would absolutely not wear such tight pants to magic practice class. Not all creatures could grow around obstacles like ivy.</p><p>The entire morning was filled with magic practice classes. After the theory session, Teacher Tang Yue would lead everyone to the playground and personally demonstrate the elements of magic release.</p><p>Mo Fan listened especially attentively in this class. For example, when Teacher Tang Yue talked about the magic release process, Mo Fan had a lot of experience, but he couldn’t help wondering how Teacher Tang Yue’s chest button was so durable; it hadn’t fallen off for so long?</p><p>The school playground was naturally not used for broadcast gymnastics.</p><p>The playground was essentially a practice ground. It was divided into several independent spaces by an invisible magic dome that Mo Fan did not understand, and all overflowed power would be absorbed by these unseen domes to prevent accidental injuries to the students who had no defense capabilities.</p><p>"Watch carefully; today I will demonstrate a basic fire spell—Fire Surge!" Tang Yue stood in the center of the entire class.</p><p>All the students formed a half-arc behind Teacher Tang Yue. Whether they were all watching Teacher Tang Yue’s starting gestures was uncertain!</p><p>"Fire spells are, well, fire spells, Mo Fan… wipe your drool; that’s your elemental spell! I didn’t expect such gentle and virtuous Teacher Tang Yue to be a fire mage!" Zhang Xiaohou nudged Mo Fan beside him.</p><p>"Oh, oh, I just wanted to learn it too!" Mo Fan only realized this now.</p><p>(Today I searched myself on Baidu Baike and saw a long string of comments, one of which described me as "the greatest threat to readers in the web literature circle." </p><p>Seeing these words almost stunned me! </p><p>Hahaha, Baidu editor, how much do you love Zhenfeng? I can feel the overwhelming resentment towards the ending of Zhenfeng pouring out from the screen. </p><p>However, this Baidu editor was not entirely wrong either. I do often threaten you guys; if you don't vote, I won't update; if you don't vote, I'll update later; if you don't vote, I won't write the ending; and most frequently: asking for votes is an attitude, so if you don't vote, I'll give up on you!)</p>
