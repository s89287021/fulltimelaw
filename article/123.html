						<p>Now, even if Mo Fan did not enter meditation, his star cluster would still be in a state of growth. This growth rate was likely not slow.</p><p>Specifically, how much cultivation improvement the small mudskipper provided, Mo Fan had no point of comparison at present.</p><p>In any case, over these two plus months, Mo Fan did nothing but focus on cultivating. He was unsure if he could complete the release as quickly as he had when learning basic Mo Fan in just half a year.</p><p>"Alright, it’s been almost a month of practice now, let’s see how much my limit can be!"</p><p>Mo Fan gathered his strength and prepared to connect all the stars with his maximum effort.</p><p>Through Star Traces, Mo Fan was already very familiar with the trajectories and methods of connecting stars. The next step was to see how many stars Mo Fan could control.</p><p>The first seven stars went without saying; they were the seven stars that composed basic magic. Mo Fan connected them into a complete star track with unparalleled proficiency…</p><p>Continuing his control, Mo Fan began commanding other rapidly moving stars.</p><p>The 8th star was very obedient. Mo Fan had communicated with it quite a bit, and after friendly negotiations, the 8th star compromised within the first week of Mo Fan moving into the apartment.</p><p>The 9th star, on the other hand, was clearly not easy to deal with. Mo Fan finally managed to subdue it through coercion and bribery. Occasionally, if he wasn’t completely focused, fractures would easily occur on this 9th star.</p><p>What is meant by a fracture is that during the process of controlling stars, external interference or insufficient concentration of mental energy led to failure in controlling the stars. Just as with basic magic, once one star connection failed, the entire star track would collapse like a domino effect, and everything had to start over.</p><p>"Great job, great job! Next is the 10th one!"</p><p>After successfully completing the 9th star, it was time for the more challenging 10th star.</p><p>The first nine stars were all on the same star track. They formed the main axis of the entire star map. Mo Fan had to continuously maintain this complete 9-star track without breaking while also establishing a new star track.</p><p>Completing one star track might not be difficult, but controlling other stars after forming one star track was exponentially more challenging and tested the magician’s mental concentration immensely.</p><p>"Kangmao, Kangmao!"</p><p>Mo Fan shouted inwardly, not daring to relax even mentally. He clearly remembered the immense pain his spirit endured every time he broke through to become an intermediate mage. He gritted his teeth and persevered. In fact, if one couldn't withstand that mental shock, it meant their spiritual power was utterly unable to control all 49 stars. During this period of control practice, Mo Fan had failed countless times at the 10th star... "Here it comes, well done!" The purple star gradually calmed down and finally stayed in a specific position under Mo Fan's control. A star trail, a newly fixed star... This was already a huge step for Mo Fan; he had mastered the essentials of an intermediate magic star map at least. Many intermediate mages probably needed several years to study this star map, and some who reached the intermediate level early found their hair turning gray by the time they could release intermediate spells. The difficulty of a star map far exceeded that of a star trail. Without sufficient willpower and personal control experience, one might get stuck there for life. Mo Fan's control had been quite smooth! ... That morning, Mo Fan, as usual, went to an uninhabited place to practice his existing magic. After becoming intermediate, the speed at which Mo Fan cast beginner spells became extremely fast. Now, it took him roughly 1.5 seconds to cast Thunder Stamp and Fire Surge. It was said that truly skilled mages could cast beginner spells almost instantly, achieving a smooth release. Mo Fan knew that reaching such a level required absolute practice; his 1.5-second casting time was still too slow. If a demon was about 30 meters away from him, it might charge straight at him in just one second.</p><p>Just finished the practice, Mo Fan felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. </p><p>Mo Fan opened it and saw an unknown number; he picked up with curiosity.</p><p>"Hello, is this Mo Fan?" Soon, a mature and sensual voice came through the line, making him feel quite comfortable to listen.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, it's wonderful to hear your voice again," Mo Fan said happily.</p><p>After the disaster erupted, no one cared about each other. Mo Fan had not seen his beloved Teacher Tang Yue either. To be honest, if it weren't for those few books on star maps that Teacher Tang Yue gave him, he might have lost his life in Bocheng.</p><p>"You really hid far away; I asked Zhan Kong and learned you were settled in the Shanghai resettlement area," Tang Yue said with a smile.</p><p>"Many things have happened, now all I want is to find a quiet place to practice properly," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"I'm basically cut off from the world now; the resettlement area is desolate and uninhabited. Even if I want to seek trouble, there's no environment for it," Mo Fan said with a bitter smile.</p><p>This resettlement area… sigh, forget it, he didn't even want to talk about it anymore.</p><p>"I was executing a mission in a town north of Hangzhou. If you have nothing else to do, come over; I just happen to be able to recommend someone," Tang Yue said.</p><p>"Executing a mission? Teacher Tang Yue, who exactly are you? Could you give your student a little hint?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>Mo Fan had already inquired and knew that books on star maps were something even money couldn't buy. His Teacher Tang Yue had given him four of them at once, clearly not just an ordinary high school teacher.</p><p>"I'll tell you when the time comes; will you come or not?" Tang Yue said mysteriously.</p><p>"Yes, of course."</p><p>"Are you already a mid-level mage?"</p><p>"Eh... This you already know?" Mo Fan chuckled awkwardly.</p><p>Mo Fan had not told anyone about advancing to an intermediate-level mage, as revealing his strength could be detrimental to him.</p><p>"Fortunately, we need a lightning mage."</p><p>"Sen Sha, I haven't completed my star map yet."</p><p>"Don't worry, I've prepared a Lightning Star Map book for you."</p><p>"...Your family sells these things? They're like cabbages—apparently controlled by some power and not available on the market. Sister Tang Yue, could it be that you hail from that major faction?"</p><p>Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Why ask so many questions? Once we complete this task, you'll certainly benefit."</p><p>"Can I get an Awakening Stone?"</p><p>"Awakening Stone... Alright, after this job is done, I can take you to the Mage Association for your awakening."</p><p>Mo Fan winced at what he heard.</p><p>What does "after this job is done" mean??</p><p>Beauty, are you a teacher? Watch your language!!</p><p>(The chapter for tonight might be late; I'm not sure when I'll be able to update~~~~~~)</p>
