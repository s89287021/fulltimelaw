						<p>"Hello, I am your training instructor for this session - Zhan Kong. You are very fortunate to be the first batch of trainees under my command since I started working here." Instructor Zhan Kong said.</p><p>The students stood stiffly, no one daring to speak up.</p><p>In the past, they interacted with teachers who were knowledgeable but only imparted knowledge. However, the military mages exuded an aura from their battles against demons, which intimidated these inexperienced students. Even though the instructor named Zhan Kong seemed relatively mild-mannered, they still felt uneasy.</p><p>"Rest assured, since you are my first batch of trainees, I want to help you pass this crucial training assessment that will affect your university admission by giving you a special favor!" Zhan Kong announced loudly.</p><p>Failing the training or receiving a low evaluation could greatly impact their grades, potentially altering the course of their lives due to this single training assessment.</p><p>"I know that you are all the most outstanding young mages in our city and believe you have sufficient strength to handle this training assessment... so, this major training will be extremely, extremely simple," Instructor Zhan Kong smiled harmlessly.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun couldn't help but frown. Every time he gave them that smile, something bad usually happened!</p><p>"I just received a bounty with the lowest difficulty on our bulletin board. There are 100 magic trainees in your entire school... so, if any of you students or teams complete this task, all of your training evaluations will pass and you'll receive an A," Zhan Kong explained.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the whole camp erupted into commotion!!</p><p>The first to react were the 100 students undergoing training here.</p><p>They had heard from their seniors that training was just about spending time at this station without bothering the instructors to pass. Outstanding performance could even earn them a B or an A.</p><p>But they had never heard of having to complete any bounties!</p><p>Didn't bounties require adult mage teams willing to take on special tasks for high rewards?!</p><p>Outside the square, the hunters who frequently visited the station also couldn't stay calm!!</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Make these students complete a bounty mission??</p><p>"Idiot, those bounty missions are even beyond the capabilities of mature hunter teams. How could these greenhorn students possibly complete them? ???</p><p>'What if none of us can complete the bounties?' Xuzhaoting asked from the front.</p><p>'Then all of you will fail,' Zhankaung replied coolly.</p><p>These words left all the students and teachers flustered.</p><p>"Commandant, why don't you just declare all of us as failures?" Zhou Min, the class monitor of the top class, could no longer tolerate the situation and stepped forward.</p><p>"Yes, what's the difference from declaring us all failures?!!"</p><p>Teachers like Zhang Jianguo, Xue Mingsheng, Tang Yue, and Chen Weiliang also couldn't maintain their composure.</p><p>What was going on here? Hadn't they been assured that everything had been taken care of? Why was this Commandant so unpredictable?</p><p>Bounties—could students handle such tasks??</p><p>"What's wrong with that? Talk to your school director Deng Kai. Anyway, getting a high score from me isn't easy. Since Tianlan Magic High School is the best public high school in Bocity, it shouldn't bring a bunch of useless people here for training. If you're just wasting time, go back to school and read some magic books or use that useless magic on puppets. There's no need to come to this dangerous relay station!" Zhankaung's voice suddenly turned stern, his previously smiling face instantly transforming into a menacing one.</p><p>A bunch of useless people for training??</p><p>These words stung all the students deeply!</p><p>"Commandant, your assessment is too demanding. As far as I know, any bounty usually requires a mature team that has been honed in the wilderness for three to five years to complete smoothly..."</p><p>Teacher Zhang Jianguo said with insufficient confidence.</p><p>"You have one hundred people, and if you can't even complete a single bounty, it only shows how disappointed I am in the hundred useless students your incompetent teachers have produced. What right do you call yourselves top students??" Commandant Zhankaung said bluntly.</p><p>Zhang Jianguo's face turned pale at these words.</p><p>Was this Commandant crazy? Not only had he assigned an impossible task, but he had also insulted both the teachers and students of Tianlan Magic High School.</p><p>At the mention of defensive magical items, all the old hunters gathered outside the square became excited!</p><p>"What the hell? A defensive magical item as a reward???"</p><p>"Boss Zhan Kong, no way, give us this chance; we guarantee to complete the task perfectly."</p><p>"That's right, we really need a defensive magical item. This life-saving thing must go to us under any circumstances."</p><p>"Let us compete fairly with these students, Boss Zhan Kong! We want magical items too!!"</p><p>In an instant, all the hunter teams gathered around the square began shouting.</p><p>Magical Items!!</p><p>Magical items are equipment that are linked to one's soul and can quickly materialize into real objects to aid in battle through the power of intent.</p><p>Like the foot magical item sold by that bald man just now; once activated, it significantly boosts the wearer's speed. If faced with demons that are too powerful to overcome, this foot magical item could be a lifesaver.</p><p>Moreover, during battles, increasing one's speed also greatly enhances the combat effectiveness of mages.</p><p>Defensive magical items, on the other hand, can directly materialize into shields or armor, special equipment that can block magic and demon attacks at crucial moments. They are also life-saving gear.</p><p>Although magical items are not as valuable as star dust artifacts, they are true lifesaving treasures for hunters who frequently risk their lives in the wild. What could be more precious than one's life?</p><p>"Damn, what a generous offer. As far as I know, even an ordinary defensive magical item is worth tens of thousands of dollars!"</p><p>"No wonder those hunters went crazy; such highly valued items are being given as practice rewards to these inexperienced students."</p><p>"The question is, can those students actually obtain them?"</p><p>"That's true, the rewards are basically very difficult to obtain. Even old hunting mages sometimes face life-threatening situations."</p><p>Mo Fan was still somewhat unfamiliar with magical artifacts, but if he were to convert them directly into RMB, he would understand it perfectly!</p><p>The most ordinary magical artifact costs several hundred thousand yuan. Damn, I haven't seen so much money in my entire life, okay!</p>
