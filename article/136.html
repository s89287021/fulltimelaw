						<p>The sound of the mirror shattering provided a semblance of clarity to Tang Yue's mind, which had been driven to madness by the demon. She pushed Mo Fan aside and retreated far to the other side of the car, huddled like a frightened kitten.</p><p>Seeing her forcefully wrenching herself back to sanity, Mo Fan could not help but sigh. Half of him felt a sense of loss, half... an immense sense of loss!</p><p>In the middle of nowhere, there was a winding road with a speeding taxi. Inside, there was a driver whose mind had crumbled and a couple in the back seat undergoing a great mental test.</p><p>Out of respect, Mo Fan also moved to the other side, his eyes fixed on the window as if what had just happened had never occurred.</p><p>Soon, a fragrance wafted over, and Mo Fan felt the sofa beside him dip slightly. Turning his head, he discovered that Tang Yue, who had been a frightened kitten moments ago, had transformed into an aggressive feline, lunging at Mo Fan again. Her rosy lips kissed fiercely as her limbs clung to him like octopus tentacles, suggesting she never wanted to leave the warm embrace.</p><p>Mo Fan did not know how to respond. Suddenly, Tang Yue pushed him away and fled to the other end of the car like a scared rabbit.</p><p>Watching Tang Yue's mood swings, Mo Fan felt utterly miserable!</p><p>Heaven, kill me, don't torment an innocent young man like this.</p><p>I'm not irresponsible! Just give me what you want! This back-and-forth is ruining my reputation as an honest man. Are you satisfied?!!</p><p>...</p><p>Eventually, they reached the city, where Mo Fan bought the suppressing drugs. His dream lover left with a heart full of shame and embarrassment, leaving Mo Fan, with a racing heart, disoriented in an unfamiliar city!</p><p>Finally regaining his composure, Mo Fan decided to take a stroll around Hangzhou alone. However, he soon received a threatening text message.</p><p>"This thing you dare to say out, and I will castrate you!"</p><p>"Actually, I will take responsibility."</p><p>"A judge has two chances in a lifetime for wrongful convictions. Do you need me to allocate this quota to you?" The naked threat was evident in her words as Tang Yue sent the text message; even then, Fan Mo could feel her murderous gaze.</p><p>"I am a man of principle… by the way, why are you in Hangzhou, Teacher Tang Yue? I happened to be in Hangzhou too. After parting ways in Bocai, we never saw each other again. Are you out for coffee?"</p><p>...</p><p>Inside an apartment in West Lake District of Hangzhou, Tang Yue, still blushing, held her phone. When she read the last response, despite wanting to preserve some dignity and pretend not to know this person, she couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p>Hmph, how could a little one who even needs the Book of Star Charts to cast intermediate-level magic take responsibility? The number of people chasing after me would have to queue up for high-ranking mages!</p><p>...</p><p>After wandering around Hangzhou, Mo Fan got into a car and headed back to Shanghai... in fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it the outskirts of Hangzhou. Anyway, taking the subway to the city center took over an hour, while taking the bullet train to Hangzhou also took over an hour.</p><p>Mo Fan's original plan was to self-meditate at home for two months and then see if he could rely on his exceptional abilities as an intermediate-level mage to get directly admitted to Pearl Academy.</p><p>Returning home and thinking it through carefully.</p><p>The immediate priority was to master the star charts; relying on the Book of Star Charts to cast intermediate magic was too slow, and burning the Book of Star Charts would likely make the stars not recognize him as their father anymore.</p><p>In any case, going to university meant spending most of his time mastering stars and drawing star charts. It might be better to self-meditate at home, only entering the university after perfecting his skills, which would serve two purposes: first, it would allow him to better put on airs; a person who likes putting on airs like himself needed some real prowess to do so in a prestigious school like Pearl Academy, and second, he would have more time to interact with new things.</p><p>Regarding something like the Cursing School of Magic, he knew too little. One day, he might end up dying just like those four people from the Eastern Family.</p><p>Moreover, once at university, he wouldn't be idle either; the impending awakening of his second school of magic would require considerable time. The more skills he had now, the better off he would be!</p><p>Decided: self-study for a year, and then directly enter Pearl Academy next year!</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue is truly a woman of integrity. Originally, Mo Fan thought that after the passionate incident in the car, she would no longer speak to him again. Indeed, her conscience drove her to send him an SMS, asking him to go to the Shanghai Magical Association for awakening, as someone would guide him there.</p><p>The Shanghai Magical Association is also known as the Eastern Magical Association; this "Eastern" has nothing to do with the Oriental Family but refers to the fact that the association is located on the Oriental Pearl Tower.</p><p>When Mo Fan arrived at the Oriental Pearl Tower after crossing the Lujiazui area, which was filled with skyscrapers towering like swords piercing the sky, his mood was complex.</p><p>In that world, the Oriental Pearl Tower was a symbol of Shanghai and a tourist paradise. Here, it was none other than the headquarters of the Magical Association.</p><p>The Magical Association has always been the most authoritative magical organization in the world, mainly recruiting adult mages and powerful ones. Essentially, every mage must abide by their established Mage Covenant!</p><p>There are several provisions in the Mage Covenant that are quite obvious. The first one is that no mage can use high-level destructive magic within the city, and even using lower-grade destructive magic requires a reasonable explanation.</p><p>The second provision states that mages cannot use magic on ordinary people, which will be treated as murder.</p><p>The third provision allows mages to have private duels; injuries are irrelevant, but deaths will be treated as murders, with enforcement by the Judicature.</p><p>The Magical Association is akin to the police and court for mages. The Covenant must be adhered to by all mages worldwide.</p><p>Of course, apart from being the legislators and enforcers of mage laws, it is also the most authoritative entity in terms of communication, exchanges, transactions, and training among mages. Generally, only exceptionally outstanding adult mages are admitted into the Magical Association!</p><p>There is a Judicature within the Magical Association.</p><p>The Judicature is the strictest and most mysterious; it is said that the judges are all monsters with unparalleled combat abilities.</p><p>Mo Fan learned this online later on. It seems that if not for Zhao He's cunning use of various underhanded means, facing off against Zhao He might not have been a match for Great Judge Tang Yue. Just recalling her Super Destructive Power Nine Palaces Fist still gave Mo Fan chills!</p><p>Tang Yue was in her late twenties and already possessed such combat ability, which seemed to be the basic standard of the Judicature. This is enough to reflect what kind of magical abnormalities exist within the entire Judicature!</p>
