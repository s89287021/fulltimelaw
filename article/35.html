						<p>No, no way.</p><p>I had previously used my mind to search and found that the Loach Pendant was just a stagnant pond. Why did it suddenly become a spring nourishing my spirit today?</p><p>Moreover, why is the school's stardust magic tool, which should have been effective, malfunctioning??</p><p>"Damn, could it be that the Loach Pendant absorbed the energy from the school's stardust magic tool??" Mo Fan suddenly made such an astonishing conjecture.</p><p>Mo Fan immediately concentrated his mind again. This time he quickly searched between the two magic tools.</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>Mo Fan could feel that there was actually a faint trace of energy deep within the school's stardust magic tool, and this trace of energy was being transferred...</p><p>To be precise, that damned Loach Pendant was like using a straw to suck the energy from the school's stardust magic tool. If he hadn't discovered it early, he probably wouldn't have found any evidence.</p><p>"D*mn it, little loach, I see you still have this ability. It's unbelievable; after hiding for so long, you finally revealed your true colors." Mo Fan grabbed the Loach Pendant and started yelling.</p><p>Little loach, dead loach!</p><p>You better make amends for my stardust magic tool; you absorbed all its energy, how am I supposed to cultivate...</p><p>Wait, didn't the Loach Pendant just release some energy to nourish me? What I should be worried about is how to explain this empty shell of a stardust magic tool to the school!</p><p>Also, this little loach pendant that I keep scolding... it seems... it really is a stardust magic tool!!! </p><p>Mo Fan felt his brain couldn't handle all this information at once!!</p><p>This is too much to take in!!!</p><p>Stay calm, stay calm, you have to stay calm.</p><p>We need to figure this out quickly.</p><p>Mo Fan continued his research and found that the small mudskink pendant he was carrying seemed to have acquired the functions of a Stardust Magic Artifact. Mo Fan tried to get the mudskink pendant to return energy to the Stardust Magic Artifact, but the pendant did not respond at all.</p><p>Mo Fan felt helpless and laughed bitterly.</p><p>The good news was: he had discovered that the mudskink pendant was actually an awesome Stardust Magic Artifact, and he had been doing the foolish thing of begging for food while having a mountain of gold.</p><p>The tragedy was that the Stardust Magic Artifact provided by the school was useless. It had no energy at all, just like a pebble that could be picked up from the riverbank.</p><p>The school gave him the Stardust Magic Artifact for only 10 days and required it to be returned in its original condition after that. He couldn't tell Xue Museng on that day that he had changed the shape of the Stardust Magic Artifact out of boredom, wondering what expression would appear on Xue Museng's face when he saw the mudskink pendant.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue is knowledgeable and experienced; perhaps she will know the reason," Mo Fan knew that worrying unnecessarily here was useless, so he quickly sought help.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue was his first choice.</p><p>When Teacher Tang Yue exposed Mu He and Mu Bai's trickery initially, Mo Fan had established a strong teacher-student trust relationship with her.</p><p>...</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, are you asleep?" Mo Fan called Teacher Tang Yue on the phone.</p><p>"I was just getting ready to sleep in my nightgown; what do you need?" A sexy and soft voice drifted over, making Mo Fan imagine the blood-curdling sight of Teacher Tang Yue in a semi-transparent nightgown with her figure barely visible.</p><p>"My Stardust Magic Artifact seems to have a small problem. I don't know what to do now, so I can only call Teacher Tang Yue," Mo Fan put on an act of being a pitiful student.</p><p>"Where are you?" Upon hearing about the Stardust Magic Artifact, Teacher Tang Yue seemed more serious.</p><p>The Stardust Magic Artifact was the school's treasure; any problem with it was truly a major matter!</p><p>"On top of the water dam at Building 3."</p><p>"Alright, give me 3 minutes," Teacher Tang Yue quickly hung up the phone.</p><p>After hanging up her cell phone, Mo Fan's mind was filled with torment: 3 minutes, how could Teacher Tang Yue possibly rush over from the teachers' apartment? Even if it were Zhang Xiaohou driving a hover car, it would take at least 5 minutes. Moreover, Mo Fan didn't believe that Teacher Tang Yue wouldn't even change out of her pajamas.</p><p>Mo Fan was lost in thought when suddenly, a faint disturbance appeared in the dark and desolate rooftop.</p><p>This disturbance was very weak; Mo Fan might have missed it entirely if he hadn't noticed it. It didn't seem like an air disturbance or any elemental energy fluctuation, silently making him feel a bit eerie.</p><p>"Mo Fan?"</p><p>Finally, a soft voice drifted out.</p><p>"Is that Teacher Tang Yue?" Mo Fan jumped in surprise and hurriedly looked around the entire rooftop from his position behind the dam.</p><p>Only moonlight illuminated this rooftop filled with intersecting pipes. The shadow of half of the dark clouds happened to divide the entire rooftop into a line of light and darkness...</p><p>The first thing that caught Mo Fan's eye was a blurred figure appearing at the boundary between light and shadow, followed by Teacher Tang Yue, wearing a long women's knitted windbreaker, walking from the shadow cast by the dark clouds to where the moonlight shone.</p><p>It felt as though Teacher Tang Yue had emerged from another door, shocking him to the core!</p><p>"What kind of ability is this?" Mo Fan couldn't help but gasp.</p><p>He hadn't even heard footsteps in the hallway. How did this Teacher Tang Yue suddenly appear on the rooftop and come right out of the shadow like that??</p><p>"How is your Stardust Magic Tool?" Teacher Tang Yue leaped up, jumping onto the dam.</p><p>The bright moonlight illuminated Teacher Tang Yue's impressive figure, leaving Mo Fan momentarily breathless.</p><p>"I don't know either. I did exactly as Teacher Xue Mushi told me to do, but for some reason, the energy of my Stardust Magic Tool suddenly vanished, and then..."</p><p>"And then what happened?"</p><p>Mo Fan was hesitating, wondering whether to tell Teacher Tang Yue about his little mudskipper pendant.</p><p>But he still felt too unfamiliar with this world. If he didn't reveal the truth, Teacher Tang Yue might not believe him.</p><p>"Then, the energy transferred to my pendant," Mo Fan took out the little mudskipper pendant.</p><p>In any case, he should be honest with the teacher. On one hand, it was likely that Tang Yue would see through his lie directly; on the other hand, if this happened, he could not explain it to the school authorities at all.</p><p>He cursed Mu Zhuoyun; the school turned a blind eye to it.</p><p>But breaking the Stardust Magic Tool gave Mu He sufficient reason to kick him out of Tianlan Magic High School.</p><p>"You mean... the energy from the Stardust Magic Tool given by the school transferred to your pendant?" Tang Yue widened her bright eyes, revealing a hint of disbelief.</p><p>"Yes," Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>"Where did this pendant come from?" Tang Yue's expression changed noticeably.</p><p>"It's an heirloom," Mo Fan replied.</p><p>Tang Yue fell silent immediately and stared at Mo Fan with her wise eyes, then at his pendant.</p><p>"Have you mentioned this to anyone else?" Tang Yue said to Mo Fan solemnly.</p><p>Mo Fan was taken aback. This seemed like a classic line from TV and movie murder and robbery plots. Looking around and at the weather, dark and windy, a student couldn't take the pressure of studying magic and jumped off the rooftop; everything fit the script so perfectly?</p>
