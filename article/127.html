						<p>"I suggest you ally yourself with a wealthy and influential faction; they will provide you with resources, giving you a better chance to advance. Of course, you must obey their commands in the future, given that they have invested so many resources in you..." Teacher Tang Yue advised.</p><p>"Tang Yue Teacher, I see you have quite a background. How about you support me? In the future... I'll be willing to face any danger for you," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Don't dare speak with such insolence!" Tang Yue's cheeks flushed as she glared at this lowly student with a killing intent in her eyes. Don't think she doesn't understand the filthy implications of his words!!</p><p>Mo Fan dared not push his luck further; he knew he had to hold on tightly to his teacher's leg. Teasing was fine, but pushing too far could mean death.</p><p>...</p><p>Following their footsteps, teacher and student found the source of the stream.</p><p>In fact, this stream source had been dammed by people to form a small reservoir, which was now a dried-up mud pond with some sun-dried fish bones inside.</p><p>"People are everywhere; it's no wonder such news is hard to keep hidden." Hiding in the shadows, both Tang Yue and Mo Fan noticed two groups of people at the small reservoir.</p><p>One group consisted of those hunter mages from earlier: Pan Xiong, the scar-faced man, and the cowboy-like man. Besides these three, there were seven other companions. They stood near the mountain screen, looking as if they were expecting a battle.</p><p>The other group seemed to have just arrived, consisting of four people with an air of superiority on their faces. They faced the ten-person hunter mage team without any fear.</p><p>"Pan Xiong, if you don't want to beg in Hangzhou City in the future, get your people out of here! The Eastern Family has a rule that fire-type spirit seeds we choose are not to be shared with others!" said one leader wearing elegant traditional Chinese attire.</p><p>This man was impeccably dressed, even his hair meticulously groomed. Walking down the street, he could likely attract many young women's attention.</p><p>The Eastern Family?</p><p>Mo Fan started to have doubts. He had often seen male characters with compound surnames in TV dramas and novels, usually very powerful. He never thought that such a group could be so arrogant, mentioning the Eastern Family right away, which felt like the ruling class of an entire nation!</p><p>"So it's someone from the Eastern Family. Such a haughty person must be after the fire-type spirit seed as well. Makes sense; the Eastern Family is famous for fire magic, and this opportunity presented itself in their territory, so there's no reason to let others take the lead," Tang Yue muttered to herself.</p><p>Tang Yue herself majored in the Fire element, and she was well aware of the more famous Fire clans within the country.</p><p>"They seem to be about to fight. But what about that guy with the hat?" Mo Fan said, unable to help himself as he observed the two groups facing each other tensely.</p><p>"He must be hiding somewhere, letting these two factions fight it out while he reaps the benefits," Tang Yue said.</p><p>"What should we do then?"</p><p>"We'll strike from behind. This time, no matter what, we have to capture Jiang Lu!" Professor Tang Yue's eyes flashed with determination.</p><p>As they spoke, the four individuals from the Dongfang Clan had already clashed with Pan Xiong's Hunter Mages...</p><p>All four of them were Fire mages. When they unleashed their power, a ball of scorching flames appeared on each of their palms.</p><p>Mo Fan barely noticed any preparatory movements from them as they used the basic Fire spell, Flame Sprout, with incredible skill, almost effortlessly...</p><p>Damn it, all four were mid-level Mages; the Dongfang Clan was indeed exceptional. The individuals sent to capture the Fire Spirit Seeds were all mid-level Mages. In Bole City, each of them would be considered a major figure!</p><p>On the other hand, those ten Hunter Mages seemed no pushovers either. Pan Xiong, the scar-faced man, and the cowboy-like man all exuded mid-level power. The remaining seven were elites among beginners, capable of completing third-tier basic elemental spells within three seconds!</p><p>"We should keep our distance to avoid getting caught in the crossfire," Professor Tang Yue pulled Mo Fan away, lightly stepping into a huge patch of green foliage.</p><p>In an instant, everything went blurry as if they had vanished into a void of darkness. The surroundings disappeared...</p><p>When his vision cleared, Mo Fan was surprised to find himself thirty meters away under another cluster of vines, staring at Professor Tang Yue in awe, whose strength seemed boundless.</p><p>"This is Shadow Concealment, a basic skill from the Shadow element. Once you awaken the Shadow element, you'll master it in no time," Professor Tang Yue smiled confidently and brightly, instantly eliciting feelings of admiration and reverence from Mo Fan, the young man.</p><p>Such a powerful and enigmatic mature woman exuded an irresistible charm from head to toe, making it almost impossible for any young man to resist her allure.</p><p>On the other side, the Eastern Family and the Elite Hunter Team were locked in a fierce battle. The exploding fire spells frequently echoed through this small mountain forest, turning the already dry vegetation into a sea of flames.</p><p>Mo Fan observed carefully and noticed that these mid-level mages did not use mid-level magic as their first move.</p><p>It made sense; casting a mid-level spell required controlling 49 stars, by which time the opponent could have unleashed several low-level spells. </p><p>Low-level spells might be less powerful than mid-level ones, but they were much faster to cast!</p><p>"Cover me and let them taste my Fiery Fist!" the man in retro attire said.</p><p>The four of them clearly fought together often; the other three immediately formed a triangle formation to protect the man in traditional Chinese clothing.</p><p>The stars connected one by one, rapidly forming a star trail.</p><p>Bright star trails crossed each other repeatedly and quickly turned into a star map beneath the feet of the man in traditional clothes!</p><p>As soon as the star map appeared, the man was enveloped in a crimson flame, resembling a vengeful fiery soul. A huge wave of flames surged around him, causing the already hot air temperature to soar, making it feel like they had been thrown into an inferno.</p><p>"Fiery Fist·Heaven Shattering!"</p><p>Seeing the man complete his mid-level fire spell, the three people in front quickly moved to either side.</p><p>With a shout, the man gathered all his fiery flames on his right hand. The posture and aura were unmistakably familiar to Mo Fan!!</p>
