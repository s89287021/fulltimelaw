						<p>"Oh, oh!" Mo Fan was secretly delighted.</p><p>It turned out that lightning mages were so popular in the Hunter Alliance.</p><p>No wonder, among a thousand lightning mages, there might not be one. Plus, their skills were no less destructive than fire mages' and came with additional effects like muscle paralysis and twitching, which suppressed demons effectively. Having a lightning mage in the hunting party could significantly lower the difficulty of hunting demons!</p><p>Great, he had successfully found a way to earn money while improving his combat skills!</p><p>"However, to avoid revealing my natural dual-element affinity, I should do some disguise. On one hand, it’s to prevent being recognized; on the other hand, it makes me look more mature—right now, I still come off as too much of a high school student!" Mo Fan made up his mind and quickly found a black wax pencil.</p><p>Disguise was not difficult. Mo Fan just needed to darken his face color and wear a gray long-sleeved hoodie.</p><p>Putting on the hat revealed a sharp-featured black face, completely changing his entire demeanor!</p><p>He found the city demon-hunting team and saw the long line of applicants, sighing involuntarily.</p><p>Damn it, this is like signing up for a civil service exam!</p><p>There was no choice but to wait in line. After an interview and possibly a re-interview, it seemed the interviewer was a rather beautiful-looking woman.</p><p>…</p><p>"These are just some candidates—do these fools think our city demon-hunting team is a leisure job where we sit around waiting for public funds?" said a burly man with a bandage on his head from behind the recruitment table!</p><p>"Captain, don’t get frustrated. With so many applicants, there must be some good ones!" a man wearing a stylish beret but having a round head said.</p><p>"We already have our wind mage—do we need another?" said the wind mage wearing a shirt with long hair, looking rather carefree.</p><p>"These are just considerations for selection—I still haven’t seen anyone I’m fully satisfied with." said the burly man in bandages.</p><p>"Or how about Ah Cheng? This guy is quite clever. In fact, the truly formidable mages usually have their own fixed teams and rarely wander around here. In my opinion, it should be Ah Cheng; his fire magic can provide enough power to the demons," said the wind mage with flowing hair.</p><p>The captain shook his head helplessly and said, "Looks like we have no choice."</p><p>Just as he finished speaking, the pretty recruitment girl hurried over, bumping into the captain's chest.</p><p>"Ah… ah, sorry." The recruitment girl's cheeks turned bright red as she hurriedly explained, "T-there’s a l-lightning mage who applied to join our city demon-hunting team."</p><p>"Really??" The burly captain perked up immediately, his eyes sparkling as he looked towards the line of applicants.</p><p>The other team members' eyes also glittered with excitement.</p><p>Lightning Mage!</p><p>Their city demon-hunting team was indeed more popular than other smaller teams, but this didn't mean that lightning mages were willing to join.</p><p>Lightning mages had always been the favored guests of all hunter teams, and even some more elite teams did not mind having a novice lightning mage on board.</p><p>After all, novices could be trained, but finding a true lightning mage was like trying to find a needle in a haystack!</p><p>Too many lightning mages were pre-ordered and easily snatched up by large clans and organizations. Finding a wild lightning mage was too improbable!</p><p>"Is that the one?" The burly captain couldn't sit still any longer and walked out from behind the stage.</p><p>"I-i yes, Captain, are you going to interview him personally?" stammered the recruitment girl.</p><p>"Interview… what interview?" The burly captain turned around, looking puzzled.</p><p>The recruitment girl and the other team members were even more confused; if the captain wasn't interviewing personally, why was he going?</p><p>At this moment, they saw the captain walk up to the recruitment table. He glanced at Mo Fan's somewhat sunken cheeks and asked, "Are you a lightning mage?"</p><p>Mo Fan took a glance at the towering brute and slowly raised his hand. Instantly, an electric arc shot through his fingertips and transformed into a crackling little spirit that landed on the table in front of him, burning a small hole into it.</p><p>The burly captain's face lit up like a flower, and he nodded with pleasure.</p><p>"You guys... can skip the queue now! We've found someone!" The burly captain was domineering and shouted directly at the long line.</p><p>At his shout, the people in the queue were unhappy.</p><p>"Damn, what do you mean? We haven't even had an interview yet!"</p><p>"Yeah, I'm very strong. I can complete a spell in less than 4 seconds."</p><p>"What's going on, are they hiring through backdoors now? The world is so unfair! I don't want to stay out in the middle of nowhere!"</p><p>A group of people grumbled incessantly, clearly showing their great expectations for this position.</p><p>"If any of you are lightning element users, Captain will make an exception and hire you," the burly captain said unreasonably and shouted again.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was stunned.</p><p>"Sh*t, lightning element users?!"</p><p>"What's going on, lightning element users also come to snatch our jobs? This is not a good day at all!!"</p><p>"Well, if they're lightning element users, we don't even need an interview. Go see other places."</p><p>Upon hearing "lightning element," everyone slumped their heads like defeated roosters.</p><p>There was no way around it; as the first among the elements, lightning had unparalleled advantages, and these people lost all interest in competing.</p><p>Mo Fan turned his head and found that the long queue had dispersed instantly, which surprised him inwardly.</p><p>During my school days, I knew that the Lightning School was highly regarded, but I never imagined that in this magical society, it would possess such overwhelming power.</p><p>Upon reflection, it made sense. When facing that grym wolf beast, what truly played a decisive role was indeed the Lightning Seal from the Lightning School. It could not only injure demons but also paralyze their muscles!</p><p>"Come, come, come, little brother, welcome to our City Demon Hunters Team. Let me introduce you to our members... Oh, oh, let me introduce myself first, I am Captain Xu Dahang of the City Demon Hunters Team, a Fire School Mage."</p><p>The imposing captain introduced himself.</p><p>"Hello, my name is Xiao Ke, a Water School Mage," said that seemingly frail girl with a sweet smile.</p><p>"Li Wenjie, Wind School," the handsome youth swished his flowing hair and said proudly.</p><p>"You can call me Fat Shi; I am an Earth School Mage," the man with the beret and round face said with a beaming smile.</p><p>Mo Fan looked at these mages who were clearly several years older than him and was slightly taken aback before introducing himself, "My name is Van Mo."</p><p>"Van Mo, I saw your blank resume, which means you are still a novice who has never truly encountered demons. So I have to remind you, don't think that being from the Lightning School makes you so great; be careful with your life!" said a woman with some charm.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at this woman and felt a bit familiar with her face.</p><p>"Oh, this is our vice-captain Cai Tang, Ice School!" Captain Xu Dahang said with a smile.</p><p>Cai Tang?!</p><p>F*ck, it's actually this woman!!</p><p>Finally, Mo Fan recognized her. Cai Tang was also related to the Mu Clan; she was always acting like a spoiled princess and was difficult to get along with!</p><p>Damnit, why do I keep running into people from the Mu Clan? It looks like I should aim to enroll in a good magic university soon and leave this city.</p><p>(At 7:30 PM tonight, Qidian Chinese Web, Sanjiang Interview, I'll be waiting for you all. Come on over!)</p>
