						<p>Mo Fan walked into the Awakening House, which was completely illuminated by luminescent stones. When he reached the awakening stone, he quickly discovered many small purple-gleaming beadstones around the large awakening stone.</p><p>The aura emanating from these small beads clearly belonged to the lightning element, which puzzled Mo Fan.</p><p>"Why are you using a lightning attribute guiding stone if I want to awaken the dark element??" Mo Fan asked Gu Liyu, who was about to close the door.</p><p>Gu Liyu's mind was preoccupied with how to extract impurities from those expensive guiding stones. He really didn't want to waste a single second of his time on this spoiled brat and didn't even bother to ask him why. Instead, he simply told the female apprentice, "If he wants the dark element, give him a dark element guiding stone."</p><p>"Oh." Xiao Mian nodded obediently and quickly replaced Mo Fan's guiding stone with one of the dark element.</p><p>Gu Liyu did not inquire further and, when he resumed delving into his technical difficulties, muttered under his breath, "Awakening black magic as your first element is thinking too much. Sigh, forget it, lightning attribute guiding stones and dark element guiding stones are roughly the same price."</p><p>...</p><p>After replacing the guiding stone with one of the dark element, Mo Fan was locked inside the room.</p><p>The awakening stone remained familiar, but it was clearly different from the large batch of cheap awakening stones provided by the school.</p><p>Awakening stones were prohibited from being sold. Every use required a real-name registration and they were essentially controlled by the Magic Association, which then distributed them to schools, military forces, Hunter Alliance, and designated organizations.</p><p>Half of the high school students' tuition fees actually went towards purchasing awakening stones.</p><p>Although guiding stones, these more expensive items, could be freely bought and sold, there was no reason for a university to provide them for free to students.</p><p>Mo Fan wasn't sure if he would succeed. Looking at the small dark shadow attribute guiding stones laid out on the table, his heart started beating faster.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Mo Fan gently placed his palm on the cold awakening stone, feeling as nervous as when that young man first touched his girlfriend's chest.</p><p>The smooth and cold awakening stone reacted immediately upon sensing the warmth of a human hand, slowly emitting a luster from its very center.</p><p>Similar to his first awakening, with closed eyes, Mo Fan could clearly feel an unusual energy travel through his body along his blood vessels, then flash into his spirit universe...</p><p>In a chaotic spiritual universe somewhere, it seemed as though tiny life forms were being born there. They transformed this spiritual space, slowly and gradually marking out their own small territory...</p><p>As fine as dust, they cautiously stood their ground in that area, yet with a hint of aggression, hoping for a broader domain. Unlike the Lightning element, which was impetuous and domineering, or Fire, which was active and restless, they exhibited an unusual calmness and aloofness that no other elements possessed, while secretly observing everything around them.</p><p>What is this????</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't figure it out at first glance.</p><p>By its color, it almost blended with the spiritual universe...</p><p>Darkness, that's right, it's darkness!!</p><p>Is darkness a color? Does it have a sheen?</p><p>In fact, Mo Fan's dark star dust had its own color and sheen. If one didn't carefully sense it, it was easy to overlook their existence, but they were there, shining with the light of dark star dust!</p><p>Guidance successful!!!</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue said that this Guo Liyu was a very famous awakening stone in China, where the success rate of guiding awakenings was much higher than at school. He didn't expect it to actually succeed!</p><p>Shadow element!</p><p>This is the Shadow element, mysterious, cunning, dangerous!</p><p>In a place like university, where romance and youthful passion abound, how could one possibly draw attention or stand out without skills as cool as those of the Shadow element? How could one flirt with vibrant female classmates and teachers?</p><p>Cough cough, I'm veering off topic. With two violent elemental systems already in possession, obtaining a skill that allows for rapid position changes is too important. Wind might be a good choice, but to Mo Fan, it lacked the mystery and operational space he desired.</p><p>Now, finally, he had awakened the Shadow element. Given some time to master the basic skill - Shadow Step - he wouldn't have to resort to sneaking glances at Heart Xia anymore... well, he could face demons with composure!</p><p>Hahaha, with three systems in hand, the world is mine!!!</p><p>Mo Fan was about to pull his hand back when a new message shot out from the awakening stone like lightning, taking him by surprise.</p><p>Mo Fan shuddered all over. Before he could react, a new mysterious force coursed through his palm and swiftly melted into his blood vessels, just as the Shadow System had done before. It also opened up a new realm within Mo Fan's spiritual universe!!</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>"Buy!"</p><p>"Gaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!"</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan was left speechless!!!</p><p>Recalling his first awakening, the Lightning System had burst in first, followed by the powerful Fire System, leaving him no time to think.</p><p>The same thing was happening now.</p><p>After the third system awakened, another new energy emerged. It didn't give Mo Fan a chance to savor the previous system's excitement before it pushed him into an even higher emotional state!!</p><p>This was akin to a man who had been longing for fatherhood finally holding his adorable child only to be surprised by... a buy-one-get-one-free offer? A double shot? None of these phrases quite captured it, but in short, he would go crazy with joy!!</p><p>Fourth System!</p><p>I have the Fourth System!!</p><p>At this intermediate level, others typically possess only two systems. It seems one might need to reach the advanced level or above to awaken a fourth system...</p><p>But Mo Fan had just stepped into the intermediate level and already possessed four systems!!</p><p>This was going against the rules, this was defying destiny!!!</p><p>Stay calm, stay calm.</p><p>Damn it, I can't stay calm...</p><p>Mo Fan was on the brink of exploding with excitement. Carried by that surging wave, he finally focused his attention on the color of the Fourth System.</p><p>What had awakened this time??</p><p>Mo Fan's mood was akin to winning a lottery, though whether it was a sports lottery or welfare lottery wasn't the main point; the amount in the prize pool made all the difference!</p><p>"What is this??" Mo Fan finally found the fourth star dust fragment in his spiritual universe.</p><p>The color of this star dust...</p><p>——————————————————</p><p>Ma, just remembered something rather important. When you're reading the book, there's a bookmark button. Friends who haven't bookmarked it yet can save "Full-Time Mage" to avoid being unable to find the latest chapter when they want to read it, which is incredibly frustrating... Although I don't always update, having it bookmarked will give you update notifications, making it very convenient.</p>
