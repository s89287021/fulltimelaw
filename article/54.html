						<p>The cultivation speed is still not fast enough! Even though Mo Fan has twice the cultivation time of others, plus a 20% cooldown reduction buff from the stardust magic treasure, distributing the time evenly between the two concubines only gives him a slight edge over Mu Bai, who is an idiot.</p><p>If I don't want to easily expose my lightning-based abilities in front of others, this advantage alone is far from enough to compete with the Mu Family's RMB players!</p><p>The question is, how can I maximize my strength?</p><p>Searching blindly on Baidu for answers gives: Buy stardust magic treasure!</p><p>This answer was basically ridiculed.</p><p>No point in beating around the bush; a stardust magic treasure is indeed the best item to boost cultivation significantly. The problem is, are these stardust magic treasures affordable by ordinary people?</p><p>From Mo Fan's perspective, it seems like there is no better way other than acquiring a stardust magic treasure!</p><p>"If I upgrade my little mudskipper pendant to Spirit Rank... just like what Mu Ningxue has with her..."</p><p>"A mere Mortal Rank stardust magic treasure only provides a 20% cultivation boost. If upgraded to Spirit Rank, it would offer 40%. This way, even if I focus on both lightning and fire elements simultaneously, I can still be much faster than most people. Mu Ningxue's starting point is already far ahead of mine. Since she was directly admitted to the Imperial Capital in advance, her strength must certainly exceed or even meet the requirements of the academy. If I continue cultivating at this slow pace without sufficient strength, I will eventually be eliminated by the Mu Family."</p><p>Mo Fan does not regret setting such an enemy against himself; the pressure from enemies forces him to find every possible way to boost his strength.</p><p>At present, it seems that acquiring a stardust magic treasure is the only quick way to enhance himself.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue mentioned that his little mudskipper pendant can be upgraded by absorbing the death souls of demons. This means he must go and kill demons; if he gets lucky and obtains a Spirit Soul, his little mudskipper pendant will upgrade to Spirit Rank!</p><p>This 40% cultivation boost is like riding a rocket for Mo Fan, who already has double the cultivation speed of others as a mage.</p><p>"It seems this is the only way."</p><p>Since a decision has been made, do it boldly! With such an advantageous position bestowed by heaven, if one were to be negligent, they would end up as a waste of talent. After the training period ended, there was still about a month left of summer vacation, and Mo Fan did not hesitate to step into the Hunter Alliance hall. The Hunter Alliance is an organization that integrates idle hunter teams; every day, tens of thousands of hunters search for suitable bounties within the Hunter Alliance hall. Mo Fan had already seen that the price of a Soul Essence on the market had risen to 5 million RMB. Hunting demons was the only way for Mo Fan to earn money now. Whether he could gather 5 million or not was uncertain, but at least both Residual Souls and Soul Essences could only be obtained through demon hunting, making this path his only choice. Facing a demon alone? Mo Fan shook his head in denial; he simply lacked the ability to handle demons on his own. Thus, what he needed to do now was find an appropriate hunter team. Almost all the mages lurking in the Hunter Alliance formed small teams; those capable of hunting demons alone were few and far between. ... In the Hunter hall, people came and went, making it feel like a trading floor or a job fair. On the wall of the Hunter hall hung a large LCD screen displaying the latest bounties, along with their prices. The lowest bounty was 100,000 RMB, while higher bounties could reach one million RMB. Seeing those million-dollar bounties made Mo Fan’s mouth water. Completing five such level bounties would allow him to buy a Soul Essence to upgrade little mudskipper. Unfortunately, that was not something an ordinary person could do! "Iron Hammer Team seeks one Ice Mage, requiring 3 or more years of combat experience, team spirit, and most importantly, proficiency in ice magic skills. Bounty accepted, average reward 20,000 RMB, expected completion within two months!"</p><p>"A Wind Mage is urgently needed for the squad, an experienced one who can distract the One-Eyed Devil Wolf. No other elemental mages need apply!"</p><p>"Fire Mages, where are you? Join our Gale Squad and guarantee efficient completion of the bounty to reap your rewards!"</p><p>Mo Fan scanned the crowd and noticed that many of the mages approaching with resumes.</p><p>The resumes seemed to clearly indicate their employment duration, number of completed bounties, even the level of the bounties.</p><p>Mo Fan was overwhelmed by the information and momentarily at a loss on how to choose.</p><p>It appeared that newly graduated mages were often shunned as no one wanted them. After all, their experience with demons was truly lacking; facing demons could easily lead to death, so who would dare hire a newly graduated mage?</p><p>Meanwhile, Mo Fan himself had yet to graduate and was merely a high school sophomore in magic studies. Such students would be nothing but burdens or liabilities to the team, as evidenced by their training experiences. Finding an appropriate squad seemed immensely difficult.</p><p>"F*ck, being a Mage requires experience these days...," Mo Fan muttered.</p><p>Just as he finished his rant, someone dashed past him hurriedly, making him even more irate.</p><p>"Sorry, sorry, the City Demon Hunters are recruiting new members, I have to try my luck. Sorry for bumping into you," said a weak-looking young man with thick glasses hastily.</p><p>"City Demon Hunters?" Mo Fan asked curiously.</p><p>"Yes, didn't you know? They specialize in eliminating urban hazards and hunting demons that might be lurking within the city. The City Demon Hunters have always been the first choice for all Hunter Mages. After all, who would want to face unknown life-and-death situations in remote wildernesses when they can serve as guardians in cities? Moreover, the rewards for the City Demon Hunters are consistently high..."</p><p>The young man with glasses pushed his glasses up and explained.</p><p>"I say Tong Yubin, don't waste your time. With no experience or strength, a mage who just graduated from Magic High School will never be considered by the City Demon Hunters unless you're a Lightning Mage," mocked an elderly Hunter nearby.</p><p>"I... I'll give it a try," said the young man with glasses, Tong Yubin, awkwardly.</p><p>"They're recruiting Lightning Mages?" Mo Fan's eyes lit up as he asked urgently.</p><p>The City Demon Hunters meant operating within the city, which was a very suitable job for Mo Fan who was still in school studying magic.</p><p>Reaching the remote countryside, who knows how many days it would take for one bounty to be completed.</p><p>"The lightning element has always been the most sought-after by each team. Even teams with no experience at all are willing to nurture young lightning mages, after all, there are just too few lightning mages, and their skills are incredibly powerful. Sigh, if I had awakened as a lightning mage, I wouldn't be put up with by those old-timers every day!" the old hunter said.</p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p>Reaching the remote countryside, no one knows how many days it would take to complete a bounty.</p><p>"The Lightning element has always been the most sought after by each team.
