						<p>"Once the people are gone, let's start collecting the treasures. Hehe, if I get my hands on that fire-type spirit seed, Yunmei will surely kneel and lick my feet. Just look at her always acting so aloof around me," said the man with a mole on his face.</p><p>"This item belongs to me. I will give you all other benefits." Dong Fang Jun adjusted his thousands-of-dollars-worth clothing, speaking in an irresistible tone.</p><p>The others were stunned for a moment before smiling apologetically.</p><p>"Sorry, this item is mine. As for other benefits... if I feel like it, I can let you die more comfortably," said a cold voice in an eerie manner as the others were about to collect the treasure!</p><p>A plain baseball cap and a face that still looked somewhat handsome—after this man emerged, the chaotic air left from the magic battle actually cooled down a bit. A chill penetrated through the skin, reaching the bone marrow.</p><p>The aura of a powerful individual, cold murderous intent—the seemingly bookish desperado now fully revealed his demonic brutality, his eyes scanning the four mages of the Dong Fang family without any emotion.</p><p>"Who are you, huh? Actually daring to profit from this situation..."</p><p>Dong Fang Jun's face immediately showed signs of anger.</p><p>"My name is something you might not have heard—Chao He!" The desperado slowly removed the hat covering half his face, revealing a sinister expression. Horrifyingly, there was an obvious mark on his forehead as if branded by an iron; such branding usually meant that the person had already been sentenced to death by the Tribunal!</p><p>"Chao He... he's... that murderer!"</p><p>The young man with his hair styled backwards couldn't help but say.</p><p>"Dong Fang Clan?? I remember you have a girl named Dong Fang Qinger. She seems quite tasty."</p><p>Chao He grinned.</p><p>"You beast, actually playing with our Dong Fang Clan disciples."</p><p>"Oh, playing is rather mundane; what I mean is she tastes pretty good." Chao He licked his lips, looking like a blood demon.</p><p>The four men felt goosebumps all over after hearing this!</p><p>They knew that the same-clan girl named Dong Fang Qinger had been lured away by the madman Chao He. None of them could have imagined that this pervert would actually eat her.</p><p>On the other side, Mo Fan glanced at his teacher Tang Yue and was equally horrified.</p><p>This guy is deranged, he even eats people; what difference is there from a demon??</p><p>"So this time we absolutely cannot let him go," Tang Yue said with a stern look in her eyes.</p><p>"The Four of the Dongfang Family are not weak, they should…" Mo Fan was just about to speak when that abnormal person named Zhao He started to laugh strangely.</p><p>His laughter was terrifying, it felt like an earsplitting sound coming from a vampire bat.</p><p>Amidst his cackles, Mo Fan suddenly noticed something dark and viscous slowly descending from above, resembling a black sticky spider web that had been set up beforehand, or some kind of creature's sticky claws reaching down!</p><p>"In fact, I arrived before you. This evil spider trap is the welcome gift I prepared for you!"</p><p>Black claws, black spider webs, looking up faintly one could see an ominous dark trap above with the shadow of a terrifying mad spider. Its pairs of eyes emitted greedy glows that were mesmerizing!</p><p>"It's a Cursing Magic type, run fast!" Dong Fang Jun exclaimed with a drastically changed expression.</p><p>The others became even more chaotic; they had never seen such a magic that bound their entire bodies with invisible black threads. During the process of being bound, as soon as they closed their eyes and tried to release magic, terrifying visions of the mad spider's horrifying body and soul-shaking pupils would immediately appear in their minds, repulsive bodies, dense pupils; under such mental fear, they couldn't control a single star.</p><p>"Damn it, too late!" Tang Yue suddenly stood up, her face turning pale.</p><p>Originally, Tang Yue planned to strike lightning-fast when Zhao He attacked the Four of the Dongfang Family and thoroughly subdue this wanted criminal. Who would have thought that Zhao He had actually set up a Cursing Web here early on, controlling the Four of the Dongfang Family in an instant.</p><p>Cursing Magic skills were always cunning and treacherous, hard to guard against. The Four of the Dongfang Family's attention was entirely focused on the Hunter Mage team at that moment, when their trump cards were almost exhausted, Zhao He activated his intermediate-level Cursing magic and swept them all up effortlessly!</p><p>Moreover, this Evil Spider Trap had been refined to its third level; the mad spider's soul would transform into a ghost monster attacking people's spirits, rendering those who fell into the trap completely helpless.</p><p>The Four of the Dongfang Family were not weak in actual combat abilities but were unable to defend against such a cursed ambush. Once they fell into the trap, the four of them were no different from invalids, just like lambs awaiting slaughter!</p><p>"We should be grateful that we didn't appear too early; otherwise, it would have been us who fell into the trap," Mo Fan said with a grave face.</p><p>The wanted criminal Teacher Tang Yue had to deal with was simply more terrifying than a demon. This guy was like a spider in nature, placing an invisible web there, unaware until stepping in, and then the reaper stood before you when he ruthlessly drew back the net.</p><p>"But I wish at least one of them was a Spirit or Light elemental; otherwise, they are doomed." Tang Yue really wanted to save them. Unfortunately, her intervention would be useless now. She specialized in Fire and seconded in Darkness; the skills from these two elements could not break the Curse magic.</p><p>"Does Lightning work?" Mo Fan already had the Book of Star Charts out.</p><p>Tang Yue immediately shook her head and said, "All the skills in the Curse element are pre-released. Even if we use Lightning to directly kill the caster, it would be no help; the curse will continue to slowly consume their four lives. In other words, from the moment those four entered here without noticing the curse, their lives were no longer their own."</p><p>"This guy is truly terrifying." Mo Fan couldn’t help feeling a chill in his heart.</p><p>Tang Yue clenched her lips, her expression solemn.</p><p>As a judge, she had an obligation to save people. However, all she could do now was watch helplessly as those four were consumed by the curse.</p><p>She couldn’t intervene; even if she did, it wouldn’t save the Eastern Family’s four members.</p><p>She had to wait, until Chao He, this psychopath, relaxed his guard to harvest Fire elemental seeds and then immediately restrain him. If he escaped again this time, who knew how many more people would be in danger!</p><p>...</p><p>(Pls give me some recommendation votes!!!)</p>
