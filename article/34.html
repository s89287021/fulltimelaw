						<p>"Might as well let it out if you've got something to say." Mu Bai was like a bitter wife, not wanting to look at Mo Fan for another second. Yet, he was strangely curious about what this Mo Fan wanted to ask him, since the guy seemed to be his mortal enemy.</p><p>"That guy named Yu Ang, does he have a Stardust Magic Tool every day of the year?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>Mu Bai sneered, "Turns out he only gets 3 to 4 months of Stardust Magic Tool annually. Thanks to you, he now has over half a year!" </p><p>Mo Fan nodded and continued, "I've been provoking that old bastard so much, yet he still doesn't give the guy named Yu Ang his Stardust Magic Tool for the whole year. Is it because he's too stingy or too disdainful of me?"</p><p>"Do you think Stardust Magic Tools are just pebbles on the roadside, easily grabbed in large quantities? With so many descendants in the entire clan, there aren't enough Stardust Magic Tools to go around; they have to be shared. The only one in the family who has always held onto a Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tool is Mu Ningxue," Mu Bai sneered at Mo Fan.</p><p>"Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tool? Are there different grades of Stardust Magic Tools?" Mo Fan asked, slightly puzzled.</p><p>He knew the function of Stardust Magic Tools but didn't realize they came in different grades.</p><p>Mu Bai looked at Mo Fan as if he were an idiot.</p><p>This idiot knows nothing, how did he even reach S-grade!</p><p>To show off his knowledge, Mu Bai, while expressing disdain for Mo Fan, said, "Of course, Stardust Magic Tools have varying qualities. The Soul-nourishing Magic Tools we can access are mostly Mortal-grade; there might be only a few Spirit-grade ones in the entire Bo City."</p><p>"What benefits do Spirit-grade tools offer?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"Mortal-grade tools can increase a Mage's training time by around 20% daily, while Spirit-grade tools can increase it by 40%," Mu Bai explained.</p><p>At the mention of Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tools, Mu Bai couldn't help but reveal his admiration. For beginners like them, having a Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tool was almost perfect; it would be easy to surpass peers and stand out!</p><p>"That makes sense," Mo Fan nodded in realization.</p><p>A 20% reduction in cooldown and a 40% reduction were effects Mo Fan understood!</p><p>"Don't get too excited. You only got 10 days of training with the Magic Tool, while I have an entire month. I'll soon leave you far behind!" Mu Bai unexpectedly poured cold water on his enthusiasm.</p><p>Mo Fan did not mind either, thinking that hanging out with people like Mu Bai and Zhao Kun all day would only drag down his own reputation. His opponents were the sons of the privileged families within the Mu Clan, who possessed abundant resources. He had to fight his way through them to gain the favor of an old lecher who would send his daughter off to him with her dowry!</p><p>"Remember, the Stardust Magic Tool is extremely precious. Do not damage it in any way. And when the time comes, you must return it on schedule. I have already warned you that this is no time for reckless behavior!" Schu Mu Sheng said sternly.</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>As night fell, the dormitory lights were out, and the entire campus was shrouded in darkness.</p><p>On the rooftop of the teaching building, Mo Fan sat alone atop a large water reservoir, fiddling with the Stardust Magic Tool he had just obtained.</p><p>The Stardust Magic Tool was a small blue dust stone encased in an extremely valuable box, clearly indicating the school's high regard for it.</p><p>The Stardust Magic Tool had been polished and featured a white chain running through it, allowing cultivators to wear it like a pendant around their necks.</p><p>"Will it work immediately once I put it on?" Mo Fan muttered to himself.</p><p>Bowing his head slightly, Mo Fan slowly placed the Stardust Magic Tool around his neck.</p><p>The chain was quite long, positioning the Stardust Magic Tool perfectly over Mo Fan's chest.</p><p>"Ding~"</p><p>Suddenly, a clear tapping sound emanated from Mo Fan's chest area.</p><p>Mo Fan paused for a moment before realizing…</p><p>He still had another small pendant on his neck.</p><p>This pendant resembled an eel and was pitch black. He remembered that it had been trembling non-stop on the day of his awakening.</p><p>Star Dust Magic Artifact should have collided with my Loach Pendant earlier, which is why it emitted the sound of musical instruments being struck.</p><p>Speaking of that, what exactly is this Loach Pendant?</p><p>Mo Fan had tried researching it several times but couldn't figure anything out. At the same time, he was convinced that the Loach Pendant was responsible for changing the world.</p><p>The Loach Pendant was an item left behind by Old Ying, the guard at the back gate of the school. On that day, Mo Fan happened to be wearing the pendant when he fell asleep in his hut and woke up to a completely different world—or rather, had crossed over to a parallel universe...</p><p>Mo Fan always wore the Loach Pendant and was somewhat worried that taking it off might revert everything back to normal... Damn, he had finally learned how to use the Lightning Seal and Fire Infusion!</p><p>"Never mind, I'll worry about it later. I need to focus on training my techniques. Yuang probably won't be easy to deal with. Besides, convincing that old bastard to send his daughter over requires solid strength!" Mo Fan muttered to himself.</p><p>Putting aside the Loach Pendant, Mo Fan used his willpower to delve into the newly acquired Dust Magic Artifact.</p><p>Willpower was generated when a mage's mental power became exceptionally strong. By concentrating one's willpower on a specific location, not only could one detect unusual fluctuations and mana waves, but all senses—hearing, smelling, seeing, and tactile sensations—would become stronger than normal.</p><p>"Strange, no reaction. Schu Mu Sheng said that as long as one delves with their willpower and leaves a mental imprint there, the Star Dust Magic Artifact would transmit nourishing spiritual energy into one's body, providing sustenance to the mage while alleviating fatigue of mental power."</p><p>Mo Fan tried several times but still couldn't sense any miraculous reaction from the Star Dust Magic Artifact.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Energy seemed to be emanating from the Loach Pendant instead?</p><p>Mo Fan was surprised and quickly directed his willpower towards the pendant.</p><p>The act of probing with willpower made Mo Fan feel as if he had fallen into a hot spring. The gentle warm currents gradually dispelled the mental fatigue caused by his prolonged training, making his mind clearer and more comfortable.</p><p>No frustration, no anxiety—his thoughts were never so calm, peaceful, and comfortable!</p><p>Mo Fan had already trained for 10 whole hours. Under normal circumstances, he would have long since gone to sleep, but today, with the Soul Nourishing Magic Artifact, he was willing to give it a try.</p><p>At this moment, his surging drowsiness began to ease under this nourishment, faintly sensing that he could still continue cultivating for a while longer.</p><p>I took a nap.</p><p>What’s going on??</p><p>The stardust magic artifact given by the school didn’t work at all; instead, it was the loach pendant he had been wearing all along that functioned similarly to a stardust magic artifact.</p><p>Could it be… Could it be that this loach pendant he had always despised is also a stardust magic artifact?????</p><p>Mo Fan’s mood became somewhat excited!</p>
