						<p>From Teacher Tang Yue, Mo Fan managed to swindle three books of lightning-star charts and three books of fire-star charts.</p><p>Thus, Mo Fan now had a total of seven medium-level magic cards in his possession, which greatly boosted his confidence.</p><p>Entry-level magic could never match the power of medium-level magic. Just looking back at that tyrannical and immensely violent Flame Fist…</p><p>However, Teacher Tang Yue reminded Mo Fan that although star-chart books were not very rare to her, most mages who wished to further improve their strength would not overly rely on these auxiliary tools.</p><p>Star-chart books were merely aids; using them too frequently made it increasingly difficult to control the stars.</p><p>Stars themselves needed constant communication with the mage. Using a star-chart book was like entrusting someone else to raise these stars. In the future, getting them to listen to your orders would be very challenging.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue suggested that Mo Fan stop using the star-chart books after this time. If side effects occurred, it would not be worth it. After all, with his current cultivation progress, he had a good chance of reaching higher realms.</p><p>…</p><p>Holding the star-chart books, Mo Fan pretended to be an ordinary backpacker, following that extremely vicious thug from behind.</p><p>Mo Fan was quite puzzled. The man looked rather handsome and carefree, so why would he do such wicked things?</p><p>They eventually walked into a deserted field. Mo Fan noticed that the hat-wearing man had stopped at one spot and seemed to be inspecting something.</p><p>"Old man, do you remember when this place started drying up?" The hat-wearing man approached one of the old farmers, who looked quite polite.</p><p>"About ten days ago, my son ran to swim upstream. Those naughty children, always telling us not to let them swim there so they don’t dirty our crops with their bathwater… Oh, he came back and told me that the pond was much shallower and couldn’t be swum in anymore. I think it started disappearing like magic on that day," answered the old farmer wearing a dirty vest.</p><p>"Oh, thank you. I’ll go check it out."</p><p>"Young man, I advise you not to go there. I heard it’s burning hot; the temperature is particularly high…"</p><p>"No problem."</p><p>Hat Man followed the old farmer's guidance and started heading upstream along the completely dried-up stream.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan awkwardly realized that if he continued to follow, it would be easy for the other person to spot him in such an uninhabited area.</p><p>After waiting briefly, Mo Fan ran up to the old farmer who had just spoken and asked about their conversation.</p><p>"So they were going upstream along the stream..." Mo Fan nodded silently.</p><p>"It's better not to delay. Let's follow them quickly." A woman's voice drifted over softly from nearby.</p><p>Mo Fan was startled, turning around to find it was actually Ms. Tang Yue.</p><p>Damn, being skilled in shadow magic is impressive enough, but does she have to be so elusive?!</p><p>"That guy seems to also be searching for the reason why this area has dried up." Mo Fan told Ms. Tang Yue.</p><p>"Hmm, let's go. Unless something goes wrong, more and more people will gather here shortly," Ms. Tang Yue said.</p><p>Mo Fan was bewildered, sensing that things might not be as simple as Ms. Tang Yue had described.</p><p>...</p><p>Continuing on, the upstream part of the stream that the old farmer mentioned was actually inside the mountain. As they walked up this path, they could see no trace of moisture in the entire stream, and even the plants around the stream were withering in large patches.</p><p>"It feels like it's been dry for one or two months. Why has this place become like this? If it's a drought, there should be news reports about it. I just checked online... damn it, there's no signal here! What the hell, they said rural areas would have coverage!"</p><p>Mo Fan looked at his phone unhappily and complained.</p><p>"It's probably not related to natural droughts, nor have I heard of such a dry season in July in Hangzhou. Let's continue following that person; we should find out the answer soon enough..." Ms. Tang Yue said.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded, just as Ms. Tang Yue suddenly covered his mouth with her fair, jade-like hand.</p><p>Mo Fan widened his eyes in surprise as Teacher Tang Yue suddenly pulled him down a floor and quickly hid him beneath the shade of a nearby tree.  </p><p>"Cover your scent!" Teacher Tang Yue exhaled like a delicate flower, sending an alluring breeze into Mo Fan's ear.  </p><p>Happiness came too suddenly; Mo Fan, unprepared, had to suppress his own scent, thus ending up squeezed behind a large tree by the curvaceous Teacher Tang Yue.  </p><p>A warm wind blew past, and the dappled shadows of the trees made the figures of what seemed like an intimate couple in a French kiss in a dense forest start to blur, gradually merging into the shade until they completely disappeared.  </p><p>A thick aura of darkness enveloped the surroundings. Mo Fan lowered his head and couldn't even see his own body; only by looking very carefully could he trace the overlapping silhouette of the figures under the tree shadow. Teacher Tang Yue's shadow was not visible at all, as if there were no one there, yet he tasted her beautiful fragrance and the soft smoothness of her body, making his heart flutter uncontrollably.  </p><p>Just as he indulged in these thoughts, footsteps could be heard from nearby, indicating that quite a number of people were approaching.  </p><p>Mo Fan put away those thoughts and fixed his gaze on the other side of the dried-up stream, where a group of people appeared among the trees. Judging by their equipment, they seemed to be Hunter Mages.  </p><p>Hunter Mages often ventured beyond Anjie's borders and constantly battled nature and demons; their gear was usually well-made and easily recognizable at first glance.  </p><p>Mo Fan felt puzzled. Could it be that the government had already offered a reward, prompting these Hunter Mages to come and resolve the issue?  </p><p>"Trust me, there must be a Fire Elemental here. Those fools actually thought it was drought, which is just ridiculous. You all know how much money a Fire Elemental can fetch. We should quickly capture this Fire Elemental before too many people discover it, and we'll become rich," said the man in front, who had a cowboy hairstyle.  </p><p>"Panda, don't mess with us. We left behind a lucrative reward to come here. If there's nothing to be found, hmm!" said a man with a scar on his face.  </p><p>"In my opinion, there's probably a Fire Elemental here. If it were drought, this place wouldn't have changed so drastically in such a short time. This should still be the Jiangnan region; it feels like we're in the northwest, approaching the desert," said the man wearing glasses.  </p><p>"Alright, let's hurry up and locate the Fire Elemental as quickly as possible."  </p><p>"Hahaha, we're going to make a fortune this time!"  </p><p>"Panda, we all know you're a Fire Mage. Don't refine that Fire Elemental yourself; none of us can afford it. It's best to sell it and split the money!"</p>
