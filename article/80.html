						<p>A light flick of his hand sent the ball of flame in his palm sliding down.</p><p>As the flame descended, a vivid red carpet instantly spread beneath Mo Fan's feet.</p><p>The flames burned around Mo Fan. Given his fire-based constitution, he was barely affected by the flames even when they flared up beside him. Moreover, a layer of frost blanketed the ground beneath him, and the frost began to melt upon contact with Mo Fan's flames!</p><p>Looking upward, Mo Fan, standing amidst the flames, let out a smile tinged with provocation as he looked at You Ang.</p><p>The scorching effect turned the frost into steam. Mo Fan did not need to move or worry about being frozen by his opponent.</p><p>"Fire Blaze: Casting it around oneself to eliminate the freezing effect of Frost Vines – this guy is pretty smart!" Ms. Tang Yue smiled from her seat.</p><p>Even magic students in school, despite learning magic, were very inexperienced in its application. It seemed that when casting Fire Blaze, all fire-based students instinctively used it as a direct attack by hurling it at their enemies.</p><p>"Level 1 Fire Blaze broke through Level 2 Frost Vine freeze – rather interesting," Principal Zhu nodded in approval.</p><p>In this era of skill scarcity, flexible use of skills was a profound art.</p><p>Clearly, Mo Fan had a slight edge in the initial exchange.</p><p>"It's my turn!" Standing amidst his protective flames, Mo Fan once again connected the celestial tracks in his pupils.</p><p>The celestial tracks linked up swiftly and effortlessly.</p><p>Another Fire Blaze appeared in Mo Fan's palm. This time, there was a noticeable change in the intensity of the flame, suggesting that this particular Fire Blaze was charged with a frenzied energy!</p><p>"Fire Blaze: Bone Incineration!"</p><p>A blazing hot fireball, trailing a long plume of flames, streaked across the spectators' gazes and accurately descended upon You Ang.</p><p>"It is a Level 2 Fire Searing. If even the slightest bit touches you, you will be reduced to ashes!"</p><p>There were quite a few knowledgeable people present, and when they saw Mo Fan easily perform a Level 2 Fire Searing, their hearts were somewhat agitated.</p><p>"Yu Ang's Ice Vines have been broken. He is going to be very passive from now on," Guo Caitang said with some concern.</p><p>"Don't worry about it." Mu He did not seem overly concerned.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun, on the other hand, maintained his usual smile, as if everything was under his control.</p><p>The Fire Searing: Bone Burn finally landed, but people soon discovered that Yu Ang suddenly increased his speed and moved to a spot several meters away just as the flames approached. The speed was dizzying, and even those with quick reflexes could not fathom how Yu Ang managed to change positions so quickly.</p><p>Mo Fan frowned slightly when he saw the Bone Burn Fire Searing fall on an empty patch of ground.</p><p>He had seen clearly that Yu Ang's boots emitted a faint yellow light, and after the light, it seemed as if Yu Ang gained an Earthwave skill out of thin air, moving parallel for several meters.</p><p>Damn, it's an Artifact!</p><p>An Earth-type Artifact engraved with an Earthwave skill!</p><p>The sudden appearance of an Earthwave skill made Mo Fan slightly unhappy.</p><p>Fortunately, using this enchanted Artifact required a mana stone recharge each time. Otherwise, this duel would be over without him even having to fight; the Fire Searing might fly fast, but it couldn't keep up with Yu Ang's ghostly movements with Earthwave.</p><p>"If you think that such a small Burn Fire Searing can leave me helpless, you are too naive. This two-year-long charade should end now. I will spare your life, otherwise, you won't see yourself kneeling before my father-in-law in front of everyone!"</p><p>Yu Ang said with a sinister smile.</p><p>The sudden fall of heavy snow drastically lowered the temperature, so low that even flames could not sustain themselves.</p><p>This cold seemed to freeze the very air!</p><p>"Icemanipulation·Coverage!"</p><p>Yu Ang stood like a snow demon, coldly and arrogantly amidst the densely packed ice and snow.</p><p>The entire arena was shrouded in a vast expanse of snow, the frigid air biting and cruel, as if an unexpected winter disaster had descended upon it, leaving no room for any living thing to survive.</p><p>The spectators on both sides of the arena felt as though they were trapped in an icy wasteland, unconsciously hugging themselves with their teeth chattering.</p><p>"What a difference, last time I saw Yu Ang, he only mastered Icemanipulation·Condensation. In just one year without seeing him, he has cultivated his abilities to reach the 3rd level of Icemanipulation—Coverage. This skill is like an ice disaster falling from the sky, extinguishing even flames. No matter where Mo Fan hides in the arena, he will freeze solid within seconds!" Fat Shi couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p>Fat Shi clearly remembered that when dealing with the one-eyed demon wolf, Yu Ang's cultivation level was almost on par with Guo Cai Tang. Even now, Guo Cai Tang has not mastered 3rd level Icemanipulation, yet Yu Ang has reached this level of cultivation; how fast must his cultivation speed be!</p><p>"It's over, it's over. Didn't you see that Mo Fan's protective flames have all been extinguished? Once all this ice and snow falls, we'll see a human-shaped ice sculpture," Li Wenjie sighed.</p><p>Principal Zhu, Deng Kai, Yang Zuohe, and others were equally moved, and the guests present couldn't help but let out sighs of admiration!</p><p>At 18 years old, this was Yu Ang's coming-of-age ceremony. Many elderly mages would boast about his 2nd level Icemanipulation skill even at forty or fifty years old, yet here he is at just 18 mastering realms that many ice mages never reach in their lifetimes—what on earth can one say?</p><p>"I think that's it for today."</p><p>"Mo Fan also has a magical tool…" Guan Luoyunbo spoke up.</p><p>Shanzhong shook his head. "A scythe bone shield is of no use against skills like Icemanipulation."</p><p>The scythe bone shield was indeed an excellent defensive magical tool, but ice magic specializes in defense; even with copper or iron skin, one would turn into an ice sculpture under Icemanipulation.</p><p>Mo Fan's magical tool was virtually useless in this duel.</p>
