						<p>The black transparent threads had already wrapped around the four people of the Dongfang Family, and one could even feel as if their souls were being gradually drained by some evil force. Each of them lay with blank expressions on their faces.</p><p>The only one who put up a slight resistance was Dongfang Jun, whose cultivation level was higher than the others. He looked extremely pained and said with deep anger, "You killed us; the Dongfang Family will never let you go!!"</p><p>"As expected, a genius from a noble family turns out to be brainless. I don’t even fear the Tribunal, would I be afraid of your Dongfang Family?" Zhao He said with a cold smile.</p><p>Zhao He did not bother with those whose souls and essence were being slowly drained. His gaze focused on the severely cracked bottom of the small reservoir.</p><p>Actually, Zhao He was also surprised. This place clearly had plenty of water, yet why would there be a spirit-grade fire seed here? Could it be magma?</p><p>Magma was usually formed by underground heat in the subterranean world after thousands of years of refinement and incubation. This type of flame was relatively mild and easier to tame and refine compared to other flames.</p><p>Such flames were the top choice for most fire mages due to their docility and considerable power, often selling at the highest prices during auctions.</p><p>"Excellent, once I refine this magma, my strength will increase greatly, and I can do as I please!!" Zhao He’s face showed a look of delight.</p><p>He still had a significant gap to overcome before reaching the high-level mage stage, and under such circumstances, his strength could not be improved for a long time. With this magma, his fire spells would double in power, and he would see if those reckless hunters and tribunal members dared to cause him trouble again!!</p><p>...</p><p>"Boom~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A loud explosion echoed as the cracked bottom of the reservoir suddenly burst open, revealing a burnt-out large hole.</p><p>The magma was not buried very deep. Usually, when such elemental spirit seeds caused significant changes in the surrounding environment, it meant they had already been exposed.</p><p>After the hole exploded, an underground heat wave seemed to break free from its constraints and transformed into a pillar of flames shooting up into the sky.</p><p>Looking at this magnificent column of flames, Zhao He’s entire face twisted into a smile.</p><p>There is actually a Fireline Species!</p><p>The pure and unadulterated crimson color indicates that this is highly purified Flame Essence from the earth's fire—Rosefire!</p><p>Ordinary flames are all presented in a scarlet hue. Such scarlet flames can only be referred to as common varieties, which any Awakened Fire Mage can control.</p><p>Flame, however, signifies the rank of Line Species. Only flames with special spirituality born of heaven and earth can be called Flame, and this crimson flame is further categorized as Rosefire. Its blazing temperature is far higher than other Fireline Species, making it simple yet brutal!!</p><p>Such a treasure is absolutely worth taking any risk and killing as many people as necessary!</p><p>Zhao He's entire body trembled with excitement. His state of extreme joy sharply contrasted with the lifeless bodies of the four Eastern Clans' Mid-level Mages nearby.</p><p>...</p><p>"You stay here and observe, I'll handle it first." Tang Yue whispered to Mo Fan.</p><p>"Don't you need me to do anything?" Mo Fan asked, pointing at his nose.</p><p>"The opponent is a Murderer. I let you come along just for an extra layer of security, not to deal with this kind of psychopath," Tang Yue said seriously.</p><p>To Tang Yue, Mo Fan was ultimately just a student. If it were someone else watching those four Mid-level Mages from the Eastern Clans die horribly, they would probably have been too scared to move. She knew that Mo Fan wasn't afraid of anything, but that didn't mean she would allow him to take risks.</p><p>If not for the Council of Judgment putting all their efforts into pursuing the disaster in Bo City and lacking available manpower, Tang Yue wouldn't have let Mo Fan involve himself in such a dangerous mission.</p><p>Since Teacher Tang Yue had said so, Mo Fan could only stay there...</p><p>Over there, Zhao He had already placed both hands directly on the surging column of Rosefire. Clearly visible was special crimson energy being injected into Zhao He's body as Cao He watched with an expression of pure enjoyment.</p><p>Tang Yue waited for a moment before taking action.</p><p>Her lithe figure could move freely under every tree shadow, and in the blink of an eye, Tang Yue had appeared behind Zhao He.</p><p>There is actually a Fireline Species!</p><p>The pure and unadulterated crimson indicates that this is highly purified Flame Essence from the earth's fire—Rosefire!</p><p>Ordinary flames are all scarlet. Such scarlet flames can only be called common varieties, accessible to any Awakened Fire Mage.</p><p>However, Flame signifies Line Species. Only those flames with special spirituality born of heaven and earth can be called Flame, and this crimson Flame is further known as Rosefire. Its blazing temperature is much higher than other Fireline Species, making it simple yet brutal!!</p><p>Such a treasure is absolutely worth taking any risk and killing as many people as necessary!</p><p>Zhao He's entire body trembled with excitement, his elation in sharp contrast to the lifeless bodies of the four Mid-level Mages from Eastern Clans nearby.</p><p>...</p><p>"You stay here and observe; I'll handle it first," Tang Yue whispered to Mo Fan.</p><p>"Don't you need me?" Mo Fan asked, pointing at himself.</p><p>"The opponent is a Murderer.

She knew that Mo Fan wasn't afraid of anything, but that didn't mean she would allow him to take risks.</p><p>If not for the Council of Judgment putting all their efforts into pursuing the disaster in Bo City and lacking available manpower, Tang Yue wouldn't have let Mo Fan involve himself in such a dangerous mission.</p><p>Since Teacher Tang Yue had said so, Mo Fan could only stay there...</p><p>Over there, Zhao He already had both hands on the surging column of Rosefire.

On her undulating chest, a faint shadowy nail suddenly materialized!</p><p>The giant shadow nail seemed to be imbued with a dense darkness, distorting the surrounding tree shadows severely, yet its formation was silent...</p><p>Even when this giant shadow nail abruptly pierced through the space ahead, it only stirred ripples in the shadows without making any sound!</p><p>Mo Fan watched the giant shadow nail in shock. As he glanced down involuntarily, he discovered that the giant shadow nail had vanished into thin air along the trajectory where it should have shot out, with only a fleeting shadow outline on the ground indicating its existence!!</p><p>Was this an intermediate-level Shadow Magic??</p><p>Mo Fan was stunned; how was one supposed to defend against such a skill that left no trace and made no sound?</p><p>The giant shadow nail pierced through the forest and suddenly appeared in Chao He's shadow.</p><p>This attack was not directed at Chao He himself but at his shadow.</p><p>Despite the dazzling pillar of fire illuminating the surroundings, Chao He's shadow still clearly projected. Teacher Tang Yue shot out the giant shadow nail with pinpoint accuracy, hitting Chao He's shadow as if a real nail had pierced him there.</p><p>Chao He's entire body trembled violently; the shadow that pinned him down could not move an inch, and similarly, his own body and soul seemed to be nailed in place, unable to move at all!</p><p>Tang Yue saw that she had successfully pinned Chao He and showed a hint of relief on her face.</p><p>The giant shadow nail was probably one of the strongest confinement spells among intermediate-level magic. It could not inflict any harm on any living creature but could seal an enemy's movements like acupoint pressure, directly sealing their mind, rendering them unable to cast any spell for a short time.</p><p>This giant shadow nail targeted shadows and could not be resisted by shield or armor magic tools!</p><p>"Another bird in the bush; this is becoming increasingly interesting," Chao He stiffly turned his body, feeling as if he were rotating with something piercing through his chest.</p><p>"Your hands now hold four more souls, all of them mid-level mages. Not only will you face the death penalty, but your soul shall be judged as well." Tang Yue emerged sternly from the forest, his eyes bearing the authority and anger of an enforcer, staring at Zhao He!</p>
