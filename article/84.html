						<p>Mo Fan, you have to pay the price for your own stupidity. Now your father is kneeling before me in front of everyone as my foster father. I think this is more unbearable than you kneeling down personally!</p><p>You Yang saw this scene with no sympathy whatsoever; instead, he laughed again.</p><p>"It's just a courtesy bow. My dad is simple-minded and thinks this way of repaying the favor is more sincere." Mo Fan turned around, his eyes coldly fixing on You Yang who was still laughing.</p><p>"Not seeing the coffin, not shedding tears. Then I'll let you become an ice sculpture first and gradually enjoy this kind of life where you can never raise your head in Bo City!" You Yang said with disdain.</p><p>Ice star trails rapidly connected within You Yang's eyes. With his Ice Silk Armor on, You Yang didn't even need to worry about Mo Fan's Fiery Dew interrupting him, and besides, that guy was casting spells faster than he was!</p><p>On the other side, Mo Fan's eyes were as cold as ice.</p><p>If Mu Zhuoyun had shown any signs of giving up, Mo Fan would have ended it there. However, Mu Zhuoyun and You Yang's arrogance and self-righteousness thoroughly enraged Mo Fan.</p><p>He firmly believed that if he didn't win this duel, he would see his old father bleeding from his forehead for him!</p><p>But was he really stupid???</p><p>Today, he would let everyone understand what a spark can ignite an entire prairie!</p><p>"Is background also a kind of strength?" Mo Fan couldn't help but laugh. The smile was so unrestrained.</p><p>In the next second, his laughter abruptly stopped, replaced by unprecedented arrogance!</p><p>"Then my innate talent is also a kind of strength."</p><p>Do you really think I, Mo Fan, would lose???</p><p>Taste the might of my thunder!!!</p><p>His black pupils suddenly dilated, and within his eyes as dark as the vast universe, there was purple starlight flashing wildly!!</p><p>Thunder!</p><p>Element of Primacy!</p><p>It embodies anger, power, and destruction!</p><p>This laughable class hierarchy will be utterly shattered by this streak of thunder!!</p><p>Not because of low status!</p><p>Not because they are in peril!</p><p>All the lightning stars have never listened as much as they do today, for Mo Fan's state of mind is uniquely attuned to the character of lightning energy.</p><p>The purple star trail ignited with intense fury within his heart and was flawlessly executed. They seemed eager to bestow all their power upon their summoner.</p><p>Star trail appears!</p><p>Magic infused with the most mysterious forces of nature emerged seamlessly.</p><p>"Zzzzzzzzzzzz~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Purple arcs of electricity appeared domineering and restless, willingly wrapping around Mo Fan as they waited for his command.</p><p>Mo Fan raised his head, his gaze flashing like lightning.</p><p>"Thunder Seal!"</p><p>"Furious Strike!"</p><p>Amidst the electric flash, Mo Fan held one hand aloft. With a fierce clench of his fist, lightning seals twisted madly in the air transformed into thunder soldiers, roaring fiercely as they haphazardly bombarded the location where You Yang was standing!</p><p>"Zzz!!"</p><p>After multiple purple lightning seals fell, they connected to form an even more powerful bolt of lightning, fiercely striking the unprepared Yao Ang.</p><p>Yao Ang's Ice Vine skill was still in its incantation when it was immediately enveloped by this dazzling and terrifying power of lightning. The shock he felt could not be described in words.</p><p>The onslaught was overwhelmingly furious; every impact on his body brought intense pain. Even more terrifying, the lightning seals pierced through his body, causing immense electric shocks to his muscles and bones. Despite the protection offered by the Ice Silk Armor, it could not completely block out this lightning that penetrated everything!</p><p>Yao Ang's body was no longer under his control; he stood there convulsing violently, all arrogance and haughtiness gone, replaced only by confusion, disbelief, and shock!!</p><p>Why??</p><p>What is this??</p><p>Lightning... This is clearly a lightning seal. Why would you, an entry-level Fire Mage, release a Lightning skill??</p><p>The Ice Silk Armor was as useless as nothing in front of the lightning seals. Finally, Yao Ang let out a miserable scream, collapsing slowly under the swirling purple lightning!</p><p>This time, Yao Ang could not get up again; Level 3 lightning seals were even more tyrannical than Fire Zhi. While the Ice Silk Armor could counteract Fire spells, it was absolutely impossible to defend against the terrifying penetration of these Level 3 lightning seals!!</p><p>The roar of the lightning still echoed in his ears, yet the entire estate fell silent at that moment!!</p><p>Everyone froze like statues when Mo Fan released the lightning seal; although the seal did not hit them, it felt like a thunderbolt hitting their heads on a clear day!!</p><p>What they saw.</p><p>Lightning seals??</p><p>This is actually a lightning seal??</p><p>You, an entry-level Fire Mage, you told us you could cast lightning seals!!!</p><p>Yu Ang had been knocked to the ground, and now people were almost forgetting about him. Instead, they were more shocked by the scene before them, which defied all logic, that they were on the brink of losing their minds!</p><p>Could anyone not lose their mind? Any wizard in this world could only master one school of magic at the beginner level; it was only at the intermediate level that one might gain a second school. How could Mo Fan, who hadn't even graduated from high school, have mastered two schools?</p><p>One Fire School and one Lightning School!!</p><p>"He... He... Could he be an intermediate-level wizard? No way, absolutely no way! No matter how fast someone cultivates, it's impossible to go from beginner to intermediate in just three years, there's no way it could happen!!!"</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun leaped up from his chair in shock, almost unable to believe what he was seeing.</p><p>Similarly, the principal Zhu, Deng Kai, Yang Zuohé, and Zhan Kong, who were already wizards of higher realms, also couldn't believe their eyes at what they were witnessing.</p><p>A Level 3 Lightning Seal—that was clearly a Level 3 Lightning Seal!!!</p><p>But how could a student specializing in Fire cast a skill from the Lightning School?!</p><p>Was it due to some special magical tool??</p><p>No, no. The purple star trails that appeared around Mo Fan earlier had already proven that this ability was definitely his own doing, and it couldn't possibly be due to any other magical tool!</p><p>And Xǔ Zhāotíng, the only Lightning School wizard present, was stunned.</p><p>Damn, wasn't that precisely the realm he had always yearned for? Level 3 Lightning Seal was the goal he would pursue in the coming years. Why did Mo Fan display it? You Mo Fan clearly is a Fire School wizard, right?!!</p><p>Xǔ Zhāotíng's heart shattered within him. He, who hadn't even mastered the true Lightning School realm, had been surpassed by a Fire School wizard. Damn... I can't live anymore!!!</p>
