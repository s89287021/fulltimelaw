						<p>The Flame Pillars of Meiyan had disappeared.</p><p>They entered Mo Fan's body like obedient children, eager to explore the world alongside their father!</p><p>As he took a step forward, an instantly scorched flame footprint appeared on the ground. A layer of rosy flame imagery enveloped Mo Fan like a cloak, and the exhilarating sensation of transformation made Mo Fan want to let out a roar as if he had evolved into a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p><p>Beside the rock, Tang Yue, whose breathing was gradually calming down, opened her somewhat dazed beautiful eyes.</p><p>Seeing Mo Fan's obvious transformation, Tang Yue couldn't help but snort coldly. This time, this guy really got away cheap.</p><p>If it weren't for that damn hormonal imbalance, Meiyan would never have given Mo Fan such a thing; it should be handed over to the state.</p><p>However, bringing him along wasn't entirely bad either. If Chao He had succeeded, things would have been even more troublesome. The price of unlocking that seal was too high—it might even mean death by burning alive.</p><p>"Confiscate all the relics, don't even think about it," Tang Yue said coldly, seeing Mo Fan's shameless and greedy expression.</p><p>"That's naturally true, that's naturally true... Ms. Tang Yue, are you alright?" Mo Fan dryly smiled.</p><p>"I'm fine, really disappointing you," Tang Yue's emotions were clearly written on her face.</p><p>This aggrieved look was like she, a delicate woman, had toiled tirelessly while Mo Fan, this deadbeat man, lay still and enjoyed it the most.</p><p>Mo Fan knew that Tang Yue was very unhappy about being drugged and didn't provoke her. He obediently handed over the relics of those people to his superiors.</p><p>Artifacts were bound to souls; once a person died and their soul dispersed, the artifacts would be destroyed as well. Therefore, they probably didn't have many valuable things on them.</p><p>However, Chao He's corpse had left behind an oddly shaped ring, which Tang Yue took. Normally, Tang Yue would explain some of these things in a teacherly manner to Mo Fan if he didn't understand, but now, her icy-cold face responded: I'm not in the mood!</p><p>...</p><p>They quickly left the crime scene and returned to town with Tang Yue.</p><p>Tang Yue clearly had some lingering effects from her injuries. She hailed a taxi and asked the driver to take her to town.</p><p>Sitting in the back seat, Mo Fan closed his eyes, savoring the unusual sensation that Mei Yan had given him. However, faintly, he could smell the fragrance coming from Tang Yue next to him... It was an intoxicating aroma of roses, sensual and alluring.</p><p>"Spirit Fire will alter a mage's constitution. In the future, unless you encounter a higher-grade fireseed, any damage caused by flames will be significantly reduced," Tang Yue broke the silence with her slightly aloof voice, still exhibiting the instincts of a teacher.</p><p>"That makes sense; I thought a mage’s constitution was always so frail," Mo Fan said in surprise and delight.</p><p>No wonder spirit-grade fireseeds were so expensive. To many wealthy people, such an improvement was definitely worth it!</p><p>Mo Fan nodded, recalling the conversation between Chao He and Tang Yue earlier. He then asked, "You’re chasing him because of the Furious Spring potion and also that incident in Bocai City?"</p><p>"Yes, the Furious Spring potion is a very special elixir; it’s impossible for it to easily fall into the hands of the Black Cathedral, especially in such large quantities. We suspect that one of the potion masters who broke the mage covenant sold this highest-grade forbidden item to the Black Cathedral for profit. Chao He should have some clues, but unfortunately, he died. I hope there's something useful in his ring," Tang Yue gazed out the window.</p><p>Perhaps due to some shameful images lingering in her mind, she now avoided looking into Mo Fan’s eyes.</p><p>Mo Fan didn’t care either; he looked at Ms. Tang Yue with obvious blush still on her cheeks.</p><p>Lowering his head slightly, Mo Fan noticed that Tang Yue's delicate hands were tightly gripping the seat cushion, almost tearing it apart.</p><p>Looking at her evasive bright eyes, the autumn water-like pupils seemed to conceal some impulse!</p><p>"Ms. Tang Yue, are you really okay...?" Mo Fan had no ulterior motives at this moment; he was genuinely concerned.</p><p>Chao He’s danger level was naturally beyond words. For Tang Yue, a woman, to face him alone suggested that she wouldn’t have brought him along unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>Moreover, when dealing with Chao He, Tang Yue hadn’t intended for Mo Fan to get involved in the first place.</p><p>Chao He was too terrifying and cunning; Mo Fan lacked sufficient combat experience and self-defense skills. It was precisely because of her concern for Mo Fan that she hadn’t allowed him to act directly. Mo Fan could easily see this kindness in her, and now faced with such an embarrassing situation, he was willing to put aside his mischievous thoughts and help her.</p><p>However, before Mo Fan could fully voice his concerned question, he froze in place!</p><p>A rosy mouth like a rose suddenly kissed him. The soft and slippery tongue seemed ready to ignite every primal desire instantly, plunging into the defenses of this innocent boy.</p><p>Always using lightning attacks on enemies, this time Mo Fan felt as if he had been electrocuted. A tingling sensation spread from his tip of the tongue to the base, then throughout his entire body, as if receiving another baptism, awakening all his cells and causing his blood vessels to involuntarily swell!!</p><p>A fragrant, soft, yet slightly wild beauty crashed into him without any warning or hesitation, the surprise so sudden that it left him speechless!!</p><p>"Um~~~ um~~~"</p><p>A pleasing moan escaped her lips. The taxi driver, who had nearly burst from hearing it, instinctively turned his head to take a look, his heart racing even more!</p><p>Is this guy too impatient? I know young people like to play with car vibrations, but this is a taxi!!!</p><p>If I remember correctly, that handsome boy called the beautiful girl teacher. Oh my God, this… this is too exciting!</p><p>"Zzz~~~~~~~~!"</p><p>Suddenly, a purple current shot forward.</p><p>This electric shock instantly shattered the rearview mirror in the car, and the fragments scattered down, scaring the driver into turning back, his face paling.</p><p>"If you dare to turn around and look once more, you're dead!"</p><p>Finally getting a breath, Mo Fan sternly told the driver.</p><p>How could the driver possibly have any thoughts now? He stared straight ahead at the steering wheel, occasionally hearing that woman's seductive moans from behind, feeling as if he was about to collapse.</p><p>(Although it ruins the mood, I still have to show my pouting face and smile sweetly to everyone, asking for votes~)</p>
