						<p>"Alright, Fan Mo, we'll give you the City Hunter credentials later," Captain Xu Dahan said.</p><p>"Credentials?" Mo Fan asked in surprise.</p><p>"Of course," Fat Shi explained with a smile. "This credential comes with many privileges; you are now equivalent to an enforcer in this city of Bo!"</p><p>"You mean I'm becoming an honorable City Enforcer?" Mo Fan raised his eyebrows.</p><p>"Hahaha, we are the City Enforcers," Li Wenjie suddenly laughed. He continued once he stopped laughing, "The difference is that our City Enforcement team cleans up not those rule-breaking vendors and street peddlers, but those who break the rules and cause trouble at night!!"</p><p>Bo City City Enforcer?</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but raise a corner of his mouth; this position suited him quite well. It felt like saving this city from fires and floods as Spider-Man, Flash, or Iron Man, while also adding some mystique and flirting with girls!</p><p>Mo Fan quickly got into the mood as Fat Shi, an experienced senior member, introduced the team's situation and main responsibilities.</p><p>"Hey… what, why didn't you report to us earlier? What kind of international joke is this? Those police officers are no help at all!" Captain Xu Dahan roared into the phone while they were chatting and joking around.</p><p>Li Wenjie, Xiao Ke, Fat Shi, and the others who had been joking with Mo Fan turned serious, their eyes fixed on their captain, Xu Dahan.</p><p>At this moment, Fat Shi frowned slightly and whispered to Mo Fan, who was still a bit puzzled. "I was actually thinking of inviting you for a few drinks. I didn't expect we'd have work right after you joined the team. It's likely an incident at Mingwen Girls' High School cafeteria."</p><p>"Cafeteria incident?" Mo Fan widened his eyes.</p><p>He had heard of car shakes, water shakes, and field shakes, but this was the first time he heard of a cafeteria shake! You guys in the city really know how to play!</p><p>"Brother, you're too evil… it's not what you think. Every night, their school's cafeteria experiences inexplicable tremors. At first, we thought there might be construction work going on nearby at midnight, but when we sent people to guard and report back, there was no construction team working at all. So a rumor spread that the cafeteria at Mingwen Girls' High School has become possessed."</p><p>Fat Shi explained quietly to Mo Fan.</p><p>"You mean Mingwen Girls' High School??" Mo Fan suddenly realized something and pressed on.</p><p>"Yes, it's a school full of girls; even the teachers… mmph, cough!" Fat Shi pretended to be very serious.</p><p>Mo Fan, however, could no longer feel arousal. Ye Xin Xia was at that girls' school. Recalling about two months ago when he called Ye Xin Xia, she seemed to have mentioned that their cafeteria was extremely terrifying.</p><p>"Alright, since the students haven't started classes yet, we'll immediately take care of this!" Captain Xu Daha said.</p><p>Putting down the phone, Xu Daha's face did not show any smile.</p><p>Li Wenjie, Xiao Ke, Guo Cai Tang, and Fei Shi all looked at their captain intently.</p><p>"Something happened. Another girl has gone missing," Xu Daha said in a solemn voice.</p><p>Everyone frowned.</p><p>Several months ago, a girl had disappeared from Mingwen Girls' School. Since the school could not determine if she had gone missing on campus, the police were handling the case. Even after several months, there was still no clue.</p><p>This incident appeared on the morning newspaper, but everyone easily forgot about it. A city had at least a million people; for the police, population disappearances were not unusual.</p><p>Xu Daha and his team had visited Mingwen Girls' School once, but the school did not want to escalate the matter or involve the City Monster Hunters. It seemed resolved until half a year later when another girl disappeared right on campus.</p><p>The school finally realized there was a serious problem and hastily contacted the City Monster Hunting Team.</p><p>"Captain, shouldn't we call the police if someone goes missing?" Xiao Ke asked.</p><p>"One Light Mage found some traces that did not belong to humans," Xu Daha said seriously.</p><p>Everyone fell silent. In contrast, Li Wenjie looked energetic, clearly excited about having work to do.</p><p>"They only informed us a week after it happened. What a bunch of idiots. If they had contacted us immediately, we might have been able to recover the missing girl. Now that so much time has passed, she's as good as dead!"</p><p>"Some schools are like this; they want to cover up everything bad. Once they can't hide it anymore, they realize there's a big problem!" Guo Cai Tang snorted.</p><p>After hearing everyone's discussion, Mo Fan felt an inexplicable shiver run down his spine.</p><p>Missing for a whole week??? </p><p>It seems that Ye Xin Xia has not contacted me at all for the past week!!</p><p>Since I don't have money to buy a mobile phone, Mo Fan usually calls Ye Xin Xia from an old telephone booth. They talk at least once a week.</p><p>I just came back from training, so my mind was focused solely on how to improve my strength and I forgot to check in with Ye Xin Xia.</p><p>My aunt Mo Qing lives near Mingwen Girls' High School. Even during the summer vacation, Ye Xin Xia spends most of her time in the school library. She also has difficulty moving around...</p><p>The more Mo Fan thought about it, the more anxious he became. He urgently borrowed a phone from Fat Stone.</p><p>"The number you dialed is out of service."</p><p>Mo Fan's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>"I'll catch up with you guys later!" Mo Fan didn't say another word and dashed out of the Hunter Alliance hall.</p><p>"Hey, wait! At least take my phone so we can keep in touch with you!" Fat Stone shouted at Mo Fan.</p><p>While shouting, Fat Stone threw his phone towards Mo Fan who was running outside.</p><p>"Brother, isn't it too dangerous to throw a phone like that? What if he doesn't catch it?"</p><p>"It's fine. My Nokia is tough and won't break."</p><p>"Big Brother, I mean what if someone gets hurt by the falling phone!!"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Why does his face look so grim all of a sudden?"</p><p>Who knows? Anyway, let's get started.</p><p>...</p><p>(Hehe, after finishing this chapter, I can have dinner and then wait for everyone on the Sanjiang Interview show!)</p>
