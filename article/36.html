						<p>"He... hasn't yet." Mo Fan replied.</p><p>Let it be, if my judgment is so poor, choosing to rely on the trustworthy Teacher Tang Yue to help me solve this problem is something I should have done!</p><p>"You trash, you are also a stardust magic artifact," finally, Teacher Tang Yue spoke up.</p><p>"Hmm." Mo Fan listened carefully.</p><p>"However, it differs from the normal stardust magic artifacts we've seen. It is a growth-type stardust magic artifact," Teacher Tang Yue said with sharp eyes.</p><p>"Growth-type stardust magic artifact??" Mo Fan had never heard of this concept before. If you were to talk about embedding attribute stones, he could somewhat understand that, having played so many online games...</p><p>"This type of stardust magic artifact can be the best in the world because, besides having the same effects as other stardust magic artifacts, it also possesses growth ability. It can absorb the magical essence within other stardust magic artifacts to improve itself. When it absorbs enough energy from other stardust magic artifacts, it might evolve into a Spirit-grade!" Teacher Tang Yue said every word very seriously to Mo Fan.</p><p>After hearing these words, waves of emotions surged in Mo Fan's heart!!</p><p>A growth-type stardust magic artifact??</p><p>Even an ordinary stardust magic artifact is regarded as a treasure by schools and clans, even the exceptionally outstanding students have to take turns using it, which clearly shows its preciousness and rarity.</p><p>And Spirit-grade stardust magic artifacts have twice the effects of Mortal-grade stardust magic artifacts. Mu Bai also said that there are only a few in all of Bo City, with the only known one being on Mu Ningxue's body.</p><p>No need to guess; it must be the family treasure of the entire Mu clan!</p><p>This little mudskipper trash actually possesses the ability to evolve into such a level of treasure.</p><p>T-this...</p><p>Mo Fan roughly guessed that this might be something extraordinary, but he didn't expect it to be so freaking amazing!!!</p><p>Sh*t!</p><p>Damn!</p><p>Such a treasure, even someone with the purest intentions might be tempted to kill and steal it.</p><p>I've heard that magical battles over treasures among mages are quite common!</p><p>As I'm still just an apprentice mage, if Teacher Tang Yue were to have ill intentions... tomorrow's news would read, "A gifted student at Natural Magic High School jumps from a rooftop due to excessive pressure."</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, such a valuable item—I feel that as an apprentice mage, I can't handle it properly. It should be given to you for your research..." Mo Fan was no fool and immediately spoke in a serious tone.</p><p>Although Teacher Tang Yue seemed like a virtuous teacher, human nature is unpredictable. Mo Fan wasn't naive enough to think she couldn't be evil just because of her beauty.</p><p>"Pu~" Tang Yue burst out laughing at Mo Fan's words, her smile radiant and captivating.</p><p>Mo Fan froze, unsure what had made the beautiful Miss Tang Yue laugh so much.</p><p>"Mo Fan, on that day of your annual assessment, you spoke up boldly against Mu Zhuoyun, who oppressed your family. I thought you were a brave man. I even considered confiscating this special treasure from you, as it wasn't suitable for an apprentice mage like yourself. But I never expected you to hand it over so easily. This really changed my opinion of you, Mo Fan," Teacher Tang Yue said with a smile like that of a blooming peach blossom.</p><p>Mo Fan laughed awkwardly.</p><p>What's courage worth compared to one's life?</p><p>He knew the consequences of insulting Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>In this society, one can't be so naive and foolish. This applies to scientific societies as well as magical ones.</p><p>Premature maturity—what's wrong with that!</p><p>"So, Teacher Tang Yue, what do you plan to do with this item?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"Alright, I know how much it means to you. It's good that you told me; any other teacher might have done something detrimental to you for their future glory," Tang Yue said seriously, her smile fading.</p><p>Mo Fan's eyes lit up, it seemed that he had guessed correctly this time. This Teacher Tang Yue was indeed different from those seemingly upright but who knew what kind of magic teachers they were behind closed doors.</p><p>"Firstly, it is a growth stardust magical artifact; don't tell anyone... well, given your intelligence, I doubt you would tell anyone anyway. Secondly, it's not that I'm uninterested in this growth stardust magical artifact, but there seems to be an indissoluble soul connection between you and this item," Teacher Tang Yue warned Mo Fan seriously.</p><p>What? This thing is also a bound equipment?</p><p>Mo Fan was truly surprised. No wonder he always felt a strange resistance whenever he tried to take off the mudskipper pendant.</p><p>"Lastly, for a growth magical artifact to grow, it requires essence souls and other stardust magical artifacts as sacrifices. It's currently just an ordinary stardust magical artifact. Although it possesses the abilities of a growth stardust magical artifact, whether it can truly grow or not is uncertain; or perhaps the resources required for its growth might be even more enormous than those needed by a spirit-level stardust magical artifact, in which case your inherited family treasure would be no different from a useless one," Tang Yue said.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded and thought for a moment before saying, "Teacher Tang Yue, what is an essence soul?"</p><p>"When a demon dies, its soul will leave the body. This soul that leaves the body is essentially the spirit after life's end. If a demon's soul remains in their body for a while after death and emits special spiritual light, then such a post-death soul will be refined dozens of times compared to ordinary souls, and it is called an essence soul. Essence souls are precisely the most important material for refining stardust magical artifacts," Teacher Tang Yue, true to her title as a teacher, provided a fluent and composed answer that almost made Mo Fan want to take notes.</p><p>"So, if I want it to grow, the best way would be to collect essence souls... Oh my, I need to quickly enhance my strength, kill more demons, and collect essence souls!" Mo Fan said with great enthusiasm.</p><p>"Hmm," Tang Yue nodded and casually continued, "Go ahead and collect them. Just remember to send me your WeChat location before you die; I'll go into the demon's stomach to recover your bones and this growth magical artifact."</p><p>Mo Fan twitched at the corner of his mouth, unsure how to respond.</p><p>"Give me back the stardust magical artifact that you ruined at school; I'll handle it for you. This is a personal favor for you, so consider it a debt you owe me," Teacher Tang Yue no longer joked with Mo Fan but spoke seriously.</p><p>"That's too kind of Teacher Tang Yue! If there's anything else I need in the future, just tell me!" Mo Fan said.</p><p>Indeed, it was correct to call on Teacher Tang Yue; she had solved his most headache-inducing problem.</p><p>It was enough that he wouldn't be expelled from school, and... and the mudskipper pendant acquiring stardust magical artifact abilities meant he could permanently possess it!</p><p>What a rush!</p><p>Others like Mu Bai and Xu Zhao ting used starlight magical artifacts for at most a month, including Yu Ang who had to duel him, for about half a year. But Mo Fan could use it all year round, far surpassing them in cultivation!!!</p><p>Could not resist the urge to kiss a little mudskipper!</p>
