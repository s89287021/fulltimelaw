						<p>Hot air swept over the mountain ranges, submerging the southern spring with a somber hue and replacing it with the cool mist of summer.</p><p>Following closely behind was an unexpected downpour, scattering fallen leaves and petals across the ground!</p><p>Bocai was a city that still had distinct seasons, but it could also be extremely whimsical.</p><p>In the morning, the sun shone brightly without a cloud in the sky. After taking a nap, one felt as if they had traveled through time, only to encounter fierce winds and dark clouds. By evening, the rain was cold and the wind icy!</p><p>"Is a typhoon coming? This damned weather… it's like watching all four seasons shuffle randomly, changing whenever it pleases!" Zhang Xiaohou complained in the dormitory.</p><p>"Zhang Xiaohou, aren't you an Air Mage? Come, try using your basic skill—Wind Track—in the strong winds outside," said Lu Xiaobin from the same dormitory.</p><p>"You're a Water Mage, right? Where's your ocean? As a respectable Water Mage, shouldn't you go out without an umbrella? What will people think?" Mo Fan berated Lu Xiaobin mercilessly.</p><p>Lu Xiaobin's face turned pale and red alternately.</p><p>Indeed, on rainy days, a Water Mage should wear a windbreaker and walk proudly through the uniform landscape, unsoiled by droplets.</p><p>The problem was that Lu Xiaobin had only mastered four stars in his magic, far from being able to release the Water Control skill!</p><p>"Zhang Xiaohou, can you really use Wind Track? Show us, okay? Honestly, apart from seeing Zhou Min, the violent girl, use Fire Zhi, no one in our class has demonstrated a complete magic spell," said the dormitory president who was always fantasizing about Teacher Tang Yue.</p><p>"Not quite… I'm not fully successful yet."</p><p>"Monkey, show us one. I want to see how an Air Mage's skill works," Mo Fan's eyes lit up as he put down his theoretical book.</p><p>"The space is too small."</p><p>"How about the corridor? It's long enough."</p><p>"Alright… alright, I'll try, but I'm not very proficient yet." Zhang Xiaohou nodded.</p><p>It was nearing the end of the semester, and Zhang Xiaohou, this boy, seemed to have quite a talent, already being one of the few in the class who had mastered seven star constellations.</p><p>Everyone was very curious about every faculty's skills, naturally wanting to see how Zhang Xiaohou would perform.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou closed his eyes, beginning to enter into the release state.</p><p>His initial movements were very slow, clearly indicating that he was not very proficient in controlling the stars.</p><p>He maintained a breathing rhythm; with each breath, one could hear his nasal respiration.</p><p>"Huff huff huff~~~~~~"</p><p>Suddenly, the books on the table started flipping over.</p><p>The old door of the dormitory creaked loudly.</p><p>Dust rose from the ground and swept up a dirty pair of underpants hidden beneath the bed. Just as Dorm Leader was about to grab it, this small pair of underwear darted away with a flashy maneuver, swaying in the wind!</p><p>"Wind Track? Swift Movement!"</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou's entire demeanor changed; his eyes turned green, and his robe danced wildly.</p><p>As he chanted these words, all the toothbrushes, cups, and a crashing rack in the dormitory suddenly moved towards a designated trajectory.</p><p>Mo Fan quickly focused his gaze, observing these scattered objects and rising dust. He was surprised to discover that there appeared to be an extremely special air current track within the dormitory; this track started from Zhang Xiaohou's position, extending all the way to the corridor until it reached the public restroom at the end of the hallway!</p><p>"Whoosh!!"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Xiaohou's figure flickered.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou, who had just been stationary in the center of the dormitory, seemed to have used a Light Feather Step and shot out of the dormitory with incredible speed. He followed the faint wind track in the air towards the public restroom at the end of the corridor!</p><p>"Wow!!!" Lu Xiaobin yelled out.</p><p>Everyone in the dorm instantly rushed out of the door, chasing after Zhang Xiaohou.</p><p>However, just as they had stepped out of the dorm, Zhang Xiaohou had already rapidly moved from one end of the entire corridor to the other.</p><p>Too fast!</p><p>Even Olympic sprinters would be left behind by this speed of movement!</p><p>Mo Fan’s heart was filled with admiration. This basic wind manipulation skill was also cool; the feeling of flying on the wind must have been fantastic.</p><p>"Aaaaaa... help me... help me..."</p><p>"Bang!!!!!!!"</p><p>The corridor suddenly shook inexplicably, and right after Mo Fan had marveled at Zhang Xiaohou’s distant figure, he had rammed into the public restroom door!</p><p>"Hisssssss~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>The tilted faucet sprayed water wildly, one side of the bathroom door was broken, and the pungent smell quickly spread throughout the entire floor without the barrier of the door. Instantly, curses filled the air.</p><p>The wind trail finally dissipated, and Zhang Xiaohou collapsed on the ground stiffly, still bleeding from his nose.</p><p>This scene was already miserable enough, but that pair of boxer shorts that had been fluttering in the wind finally fell down after losing the wind force, ending up covering his face haphazardly.</p><p>Lu Xiaobin and the dorm monitor quickly dragged Zhang Xiaohou back to the dorm.</p><p>The monitor reclaimed his boxer shorts and upon opening them found a patch of bloodstain.</p><p>"Monitor, are you also getting your period?" Lu Xiaobin laughed wildly there.</p><p>"Get lost." The dorm supervisor reluctantly threw his beloved pair of trunks into the trash bin.</p><p>The wind-based skill felt quite good too; its movement speed didn't seem any slower than a car moving at a steady pace. It was just that Zhang Xiaohou wasn't very qualified in subject three, not knowing how to park by the side of the road.</p><p>"You bunch of brats! The annual examination is almost here, and instead of properly meditating, you're causing trouble here! If I catch you again, I'll peel your skin off!" The dorm supervisor's roar echoed throughout the corridor amidst the wind and rain.</p><p>...</p><p>The annual examination finally arrived. For many people, today was a nightmare because they might be expelled from the school. These individuals were actually the most tragic, having no face to return home and see their parents.</p><p>But magic studies are no joke; every magical high school has this system. Unsuitable candidates for magic would be politely asked to leave early so that they could find other paths instead of wasting time in the boundless sea of magic.</p><p>For those diligent students who relentlessly practiced, today was the day to prove themselves, especially those few academically gifted individuals who could already use their skills!</p><p>The typhoon had passed, and the morning weather was clear and pleasant.</p><p>In the Mu Family Estate.</p><p>Mu Bai specially wore a white shirt adorned with plum blossoms and a pair of sharp trousers. Overall, he exuded an air of good upbringing and modesty without any display of arrogance.</p><p>With his handsome looks and this stylish yet understated outfit, he had already captured many girls' hearts.</p><p>But as a proper member of the Mu Family's prestigious lineage, how could he be interested in such common women? His goal was someone like Mu Ningxue, that heavenly beauty... Of course, if Teacher Tang Yue was willing to comply, he would be very happy with that.</p><p>"Mu Bai, today you must perform well. You should know that our Mu Family always allocates some cultivation resources to young descendants. This allocation is based on both the family's contributions and the cultivation achievements of the younger generation. You need to make your almost forgotten little branch of the Mu Family proud!" Early in the morning, Mu He personally drove Mu Bai to school in a black sedan.</p><p>Mu He was the chairman of Tianlan High School, and today's annual examination would be hosted by him.</p><p>Though Mu Bai was his nephew, Mu He hoped that Mu Bai could make him look good in front of the other board members!</p><p>"Uncle, you can rest assured!" Mu Bai said with full confidence.</p><p>After saying that, Mu Bai recalled something and turned his eyes slightly, then asked in a low voice, "Uncle, I heard that Mu Ningxue will be going to Tianlan High School today as well?"</p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p>"Uncle, you can rest assured!" Mu Bai said with full confidence.</p><p>After saying that, Mu Bai recalled something and turned his eyes slightly, then asked in a low voice, "Uncle, I heard that Mu Ningxue will be attending Tianlan High School today as well?"</p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p>"Uncle, rest easy!" Mu Bai declared confidently.</p><p>Just then, he remembered something and shifted his gaze, then softly inquired, "Uncle, I’ve heard that Mu Ningxue is also going to Tianlan High School today."</p><p>----------------------------------------</p>
