						<p>Mo Fan was anxious as if his heart was on fire. At that moment, he wished he had a teleportation skill to quickly reach Mingwen Girls' High School.</p><p>Sitting in a slow-moving taxi, he arrived at his aunt Mo Qing's house.</p><p>Rushing to Aunt Mo Qing's place, Mo Fan just turned the corner when he almost bumped into a girl sitting in a wheelchair.</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan," Ye Xinxia smiled sweetly, surprised and delighted.</p><p>"He Xin Xia, as long as you're okay, I was terrified."</p><p>Seeing Ye Xinxia's smile, Mo Fan's heart calmed down immediately.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"Why couldn't I reach you on your phone? It said it was out of service."</p><p>"I owe some money, and I didn't want to pay it," Ye Xinxia said with her head lowered, a little embarrassed.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Okay, the girl just wanted to save a bit of money.</p><p>Whatever, as long as she's okay, Mo Fan felt relieved all over.</p><p>"How was your training going?" Ye Xinxia handed Mo Fan a handkerchief.</p><p>These days, there are too few girls carrying handkerchiefs. It's not that Xinxia is being artistic; it's about saving money.</p><p>Mo Fan wiped his sweat and even inhaled the scent on the handkerchief. Hmm, still that alluring body odor, the one he had previously hidden was already gone... uh, he accidentally revealed his perverted side.</p><p>"I heard that a girl went missing from your school," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Ye Xinxia nodded heavily, "It's so scary, Aunt hasn't let me go to school for some time now."</p><p>"You tell me what happened."</p><p>"It was a girl from the class next to mine. Her name is Lin Yun'er. On the day she went missing, I was also in the library. She even greeted me and said she would return to her dormitory, but I haven't seen her since then. The surveillance cameras at all school entrances didn't capture her leaving the school," Ye Xinxia whispered.</p><p>Seeing her pale face as she recalled this event, Mo Fan lightly patted her shoulder.</p><p>"So, you were the last person to see her?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"Yes, the police have questioned me many times, but that's all I know. However..." Ye Xinxia lowered her head.</p><p>"What is it?" Mo Fan pressed.</p><p>"After leaving the library, I smelled an unusual odor, like a sour smell wafting from somewhere in the school cafeteria. Our library is quite far from the cafeteria. At the time, my body inexplicably turned cold, as if something was watching me. I was very scared and hurriedly left."</p><p>Mo Fan frowned; so she had been close to danger!</p><p>"Brother Mo Fan, if I hadn't left early..."</p><p>Ye Xinxia's mood seemed very despondent.</p><p>"Yes, it's good you left early, or else you might have become that missing girl," Mo Fan secretly rejoiced.</p><p>But Ye Xinxia shook her head and blamed herself softly, almost inaudibly: "I think that terrifying thing initially targeted me. My hasty departure made it turn to the lone Lin Yun'er. I... I should have found Lin Yun'er and left school with her."</p><p>After hearing Ye Xinxia's self-reproach, Mo Fan didn't know what to say.</p><p>What was this girl thinking in her head?</p><p>If she hadn't left early, both of them might have gone missing together. If there really were some foul things in the school, how could two girls possibly defend themselves against it?</p><p>"You can't blame yourself for that. Even if you had told Lin Yun'er, she would still think you were overreacting. You've always been more sensitive than others from a young age, but you have trouble moving quickly. It's already amazing that you managed to protect yourself."</p><p>Ye Xinxia looked at Mo Fan with hope: "Brother Mo Fan, do you think Lin Yun'er might have..."</p><p>"Most likely... oh, no, definitely not. You know, I'm now a member of the City Monster Hunting Team, and this matter will be resolved. How can I let my adorable Xie Xin Xia stay in such a dangerous school!" Mo Fan said, patting his chest.</p><p>These were Mo Fan's thoughts.</p><p>You see, if something like this happened at Mingwen Girls' High School, he would come here even without being part of the City Monster Hunting Team. Ye Xin Xia had already lost important things during her growth, and Mo Fan couldn't bear for her to suffer any further injuries after relying on a wheelchair throughout her youth.</p><p>She was so pure and kind; whenever she got hurt while fighting with kids from other districts as a child, Mo Fan would hide at Ye Xin Xia's place. Ye Xin Xia always carefully cleaned and dressed his bruises and wounds, even blushing to lie for him...</p><p>Since then, Mo Fan had silently vowed to take good care of her and prevent her from any harm.</p><p>"These days, just stay home. We'll clean up the harmful things..." Mo Fan patted Ye Xin Xia's little head.</p><p>"Yes, yes," Ye Xin Xia nodded obediently.</p><p>After learning that Mo Fan was a lightning mage, Ye Xin Xia indeed felt much more at ease, and she could also sense that her Big Brother Mo Fan was gradually becoming stronger.</p><p>He had transformed from an ordinary teenager to a magician, and now he was a member of the City Monster Hunting Team. Every time she saw him, it seemed like he had changed in some way, leading her to guess that during the times she didn't see him, he must have worked very hard.</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan, are you all sunbathing while training?"</p><p>"No, why do you ask?"</p><p>"You've gotten so dark I barely recognize you."</p><p>"..."</p><p>...</p><p>After leaving his aunt's place, Mo Fan headed towards Mingwen Girls' High School.</p><p>Damn it, in a city and within a school, such terrifying things could exist. Allowing the country's blossoms to grow up in such an environment was something even the teachers would tolerate, but he couldn't stand for it!</p><p>The young maidens of Mingwen Academy, do not panic, do not fear, your black horse prince has come to rescue you from the flames!! </p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>With a handsome kick to the school gates, Mo Fan was ready to enjoy the adoring gazes of hundreds of skirt-clad girls. However, upon glancing around, he found the entire campus eerily empty. A few stray cats, startled in the flower beds, peeked their heads out with disdainful looks at Mo Fan standing by the gate, as if saying: Where did this idiot come from? He scared me to death!</p><p>Oh, oh, I forgot it's still summer vacation; the girls haven't returned to school yet.</p><p>"Hmm? You arrived earlier than me," a woman's voice came from behind him shortly after.</p><p>Mo Fan turned around and saw none other than the incredibly proud Guo Caitang.</p><p>Apart from her ample bosom and slender long legs, which were pleasing to the eye, she exuded an aura of "bitch" all over!</p>
