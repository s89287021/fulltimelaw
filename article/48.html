						<p>At the mountain mouth, to reduce the flames' scorching effect, the ghost wolf beast jumped into the pond.</p><p>For some reason, after this thoroughly soaked ghost wolf beast crawled out of the pond, it completely transformed. Its originally green pupils abruptly turned blood-red.</p><p>Ghost wolf beasts are wild and untamable creatures; a strong stimulus can easily drive them to madness.</p><p>On the battlefield, such madness in ghost wolf beasts would have remarkable effects, but at this moment, it would be a catastrophe for the students!</p><p>The blood-red pupils were filled with the most terrifying ferocity. The enraged ghost wolf beast's eyes locked onto Mo Fan with unwavering intensity, and its killing intent condensed into a chilling cold aura that assaulted Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan froze in place.</p><p>This ghost wolf beast was far more powerful and cruel than they had imagined!</p><p>"M… monkey!" Mo Fan barely had the strength to speak.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou also sensed that terrifying killing intent. He frantically linked the star patterns.</p><p>Previously, he had been unable to complete the wind-based star pattern, but now he had to do so; otherwise, Mo Fan would be instantly killed by the ghost wolf beast.</p><p>"Aaaaaaaaaaaah~~~~~~~~~~~~~!"</p><p>The ghost wolf beast's limbs pounded against the ground, raising a whirlwind of dust in its wake as it raced forward.</p><p>That explosive power!</p><p>The ghost wolf beast went from standing still to sprinting in less than a second. Its explosive power was truly terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>"Fangge!"</p><p>At the critical moment, Zhang Xiaohou tightly grabbed Mo Fan, who was somewhat stiff.</p><p>"Aaaaagh!"</p><p>The fangs of the Shadow Wolf Beast bit into thin air, emitting a shrill collision sound.</p><p>Having missed its target, it felt as if its dignity had been greatly insulted. This terrifying creature erupted with astonishing speed once more, chasing after the cave.</p><p>Inside the cave, many people were still dazed from the impact. They had just managed to crawl up when they were immediately confronted by a frenzied Shadow Wolf Beast.</p><p>These students were all knocked flying, splattering blood everywhere.</p><p>"Run, run fast, faster!!" Mo Fan looked behind and could feel that the speed of the Shadow Wolf Beast was slightly faster than Zhang Xiaohou's wind trail sprint.</p><p>"I... I'm doing my best!" Zhang Xiaohou was drenched in cold sweat but dared not be the slightest bit complacent.</p><p>The wind whistled in his ears, and a monstrous beast wolf was charging after him from behind. His heartbeat almost stopped.</p><p>"It's just ahead, you run fast, I'll take care of it!" Mo Fan finally found his destination and said with absolute certainty.</p><p>"That won't do, I can't leave Fangge..."</p><p>Friends in adversity show their true feelings.</p><p>If they were still alive, Mo Fan would damn well be moved by this.</p><p>The problem was, whether they could survive now depended entirely on this damned cave.</p><p>The depths of the cave revealed a larger cavern, with its floor covered in jagged and bizarre rocks. Hanging from the ceiling were numerous stalactites.</p><p>There were no students here anymore, nor any path to run; it was a dead end.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou had already done his best, buying enough time for their survival with his Wind Track. Now, the shadow wolves were hot on their trail, leaving them with nowhere to run.</p><p>"Fan, aren't we great? By luring the shadow wolves here, the others can escape…" Zhang Xiaohou suddenly said in a mournful tone.</p><p>Mo Fan leaned against the cave wall, looking at the shadow wolves that had found them, and retorted sarcastically, "Bullshit. I, Mo Fan, would never do something like that."</p><p>"Be careful!!!"</p><p>No sooner had Mo Fan finished speaking than a burst of flying debris spewed from the mouth of the shadow wolf, sweeping up the sharp rocks in the cave and pelting towards the two of them.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou was after all a Wind user, quicker by several degrees.</p><p>He intended to dodge but realized that Mo Fan could never be as fast as he was.</p><p>With a grim determination, Zhang Xiaohou pushed Mo Fan heavily, sending him behind a large boulder…</p><p>He himself could no longer dodge in time. His body was instantly pierced by the sharp stones, revealing prominent bloodstains!</p><p>"Brute, you brute! If anything happens to Monkey, I, Mo Fan, will crush you into paste!!" Mo Fan roared in anger.</p><p>Time did not allow Mo Fan to check Zhang Xiaohou's fate. Taking advantage of the shadow wolf’s breath attack, Mo Fan closed his eyes!</p><p>When he opened them again, his pupils were filled with dense purple electric sparks!</p><p>His gaze as swift as lightning, hair ablaze like fire!</p><p>Stars flickered within Mo Fan’s pupils, and the purple stars, sensing their master's anger, united in a way they never had before. They formed a perfect purple star trajectory, shining brightly in the dark cavern.</p><p>At the center of the starry pathway, Mo Fan stood tall and proud.</p><p>"Thunder Seal? Python Scar!!"</p><p>With his raised hand tightly clenched, lightning surged out from between his fingers.</p><p>Upon receiving his command, Thunder Seal? Python Scar transformed into fierce lightning warriors, some striking, others entangling, still others lashing!</p><p>One after another, these lightning marks struck the shadow wolf beast, electrifying its muscles and tearing open its flesh!!</p><p>"Ahhhwoooooo~~~~~~~~~~~!"</p><p>The Thunder Seal had more power than Flame Scorch? Burn. It was also the only skill capable of injuring the shadow wolf beast.</p><p>This shadow wolf beast's fur was already scorched black, with black blood gushing out from its muscles and skin!</p><p>Despite the intense pain and paralysis caused by the Thunder Seal, those fiery red eyes remained fixed on Mo Fan.</p><p>Yes, it was a murderous intent!</p><p>This frenzied summoned creature had completely degenerated into a demonic entity brimming with savage killing instincts. Its eyes saw only slaughter and contempt for life!</p><p>"Flame Scorch? Bone Burn!"</p><p>Mo Fan connected the star beads again. This time, his pupils turned from purple to burning red.</p><p>The fire-themed star beads rapidly linked under his gaze, quickly forming a starry pathway that transmitted magical energy into Mo Fan's body!</p><p>Fixing his eyes on this shadow wolf beast, Mo Fan felt no fear at all now; only anger and determination filled his heart.</p><p>The pupils of the Shadow Wolf Beast flickered with disdain towards the weak human, as if it were saying: What's the point in trying again? Burning Bones cannot kill me completely, but the moment my muscle paralysis ends, I can tear you in half at the waist!</p><p>Despite the agony of Burning Bones, the Shadow Wolf Beast could still endure another round of its internal combustion.</p><p>Neither Thunder Seal? Python Scar nor Fire Surge? Burning Bones were sufficient to kill it, so the final outcome would inevitably be this human becoming its meal!</p><p>"You beast..." Mo Fan could feel the contempt in the Shadow Wolf Beast's eyes.</p><p>"Watch who dies!!" Mo Fan roared in anger. A cluster of fiery flames condensed into a blazing inferno in his palm.</p><p>The pupils of the Shadow Wolf Beast flickered with disdain towards the weak human, as if it were saying: What’s the point in trying again? Burning Bones cannot kill me completely, but the moment my muscle paralysis ends, I can tear you in half at the waist!</p><p>Despite the agony of Burning Bones, the Shadow Wolf Beast could still endure another round of its internal combustion.</p><p>Neither Thunder Seal·Python Scar nor Fire Surge·Burning Bones were sufficient to kill it, so the final outcome would inevitably be this human becoming its meal!</p><p>"You beast..." Mo Fan could feel the contempt in the Shadow Wolf Beast's eyes.</p><p>"Watch who dies!!" Mo Fan roared in anger. A cluster of fiery flames condensed into a blazing inferno in his palm.</p><p>The pupils of the Shadow Wolf Beast flashed with disdain for the feeble human, as if it were mocking: What’s the point in trying again? Burning Bones cannot kill me completely; the moment my paralysis ends, I can tear you in half at the waist!</p><p>Though the agony of Burning Bones was unbearable, the Shadow Wolf Beast could still endure another round of its internal combustion.</p><p>Neither Thunder Seal·Python Scar nor Fire Surge·Burning Bones were enough to kill it. The final outcome would inevitably be this human becoming its meal!</p><p>"You beast..." Mo Fan sensed the contempt in the Shadow Wolf Beast's eyes.</p><p>"Watch who dies!!" Mo Fan roared in anger.
