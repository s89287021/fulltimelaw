						<p>Outside Water Lotus High School, a light drizzle was falling.</p><p>At the school gate, it was packed with parents holding umbrellas. Their faces, wet from the rain, were full of hope.</p><p>Today was their children's crucial academic day! Whether they could get into Tianlan Magic High School and eventually secure admission to a prestigious university depended on their performance today!</p><p>You didn't misread that.</p><p>It was magic high school!</p><p>In this society, magic is revered!</p><p>All children are required to undergo nine years of compulsory magic education. After mastering the basic theories and life skills in magic, they take an exam similar to the college entrance examination. Only those who pass can enter Magic High School and become true magicians!</p><p>...</p><p>Petals were knocked down by the rain on the straight road of the campus. After the bell rang, students surged out, either walking alone or searching for their friends to discuss today's exam content.</p><p>"Hey, Mu Bai, did you guys figure out the seven elements of elemental magic—ice, fire, earth, water, wind, light, and thunder?" asked a white-faced boy wearing a small bow tie.</p><p>"Perfect answer!" replied Mu Bai, who could be called a heartthrob with his hairstyle, height, and appearance.</p><p>"As expected from our top student, managing to solve such a complex mixed-element problem... Hey, isn't that Mo Fan, who only barely passed the simulation exam with 6 points?" said Zhao Kun San, whose face was covered in pimples.</p><p>The heartthrob Mu Bai shot an disdainful glance at the solitary boy holding an umbrella and said, "This guy is going to end up like his father, working as a used truck purchaser."</p><p>"That's just your Mu family's servant, haha!"</p><p>These three spoke rather boldly, not fearing that the boy named Mo Fan would hear them.</p><p>After mocking him, they left in a leisurely manner, clearly confident of their admission to Magic High School.</p><p>Walking out of the school gate with a black Huang Feihong umbrella, Mo Fan left on his own. Looking back at the campus he was about to leave, all the words he wanted to say boiled down to two: damn! </p><p>Could it be otherwise? </p><p>Mo Fan originally did not belong to this world; he was a genius student who had always despised regular exams and often submitted blank papers. </p><p>It was normal for his classmates and teachers to think of him as a dunce, just like how there was no reason for a college student to waste over an hour sitting around for that small red flower.</p><p>Originally, Mo Fan planned to be somewhat serious during the high school entrance exam, casually securing first or second place in the whole school, humiliating someone like Mu Bai, that foolish guy, by entering the best high school in the city...</p><p>But something unexpected happened. </p><p>While he was sleeping in the back mountain of the school as a good student, damn it, he suddenly found himself in this world!</p><p>Magic!!</p><p>The classmates, teachers, dad, and sister around him had not changed, but damn it, everything else in the world had.</p><p>His world, which revered science, turned into one that held magic above all.</p><p>Mathematics, physics, and chemistry became black magic, white magic, and dimensional magic!</p><p>Academic departments became Fire Department, Ice Department, Thunder Department!</p><p>It was fine for things to change, Mo Fan actually did not resist this magic at all; in fact, when he realized magic really existed, his whole body felt like a Spartan warrior. But it just had to happen right before his exams.</p><p>This left him completely clueless about magic knowledge!</p><p>So, from a prodigy who wanted to pretend to be a pig eating a tiger, Mo Fan suddenly became a real dunce, enduring ridicule and mockery!</p><p>The only thing worth celebrating is that during these nine years of compulsory magic education, he learned a bunch of miscellaneous theoretical knowledge—only things closely related to daily life. True magic would not be introduced until high school.</p><p>Becoming a true mage requires an important step: "Magic Awakening"!</p><p>Magic Awakening will be initiated during the opening ceremony of high school, in front of the entire faculty and staff. Even if you haven't mastered the preceding theory, you can still potentially unlock your own magical path at that time.</p><p>Mo Fan genuinely loved magic; this was undoubtedly a perfect rebirth into a world of fantasy for him.</p><p>He also wanted to become a supreme mage who could dance on the rooftops summoning fire and thunder, making some contribution to saving the world.</p><p>But alas, this exam...</p><p>Let's put it this way: through his relentless efforts before the exam, he finally reached the level of understanding the questions. As for whether the answers were correct... well, happiness is enough.</p><p>...</p><p>"Mo Fan, Mo Fan..." In the crowd, a middle-aged man with a waxen complexion raised his hand towards Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan looked at this familiar face in surprise and called out, "Dad, why are you here?"</p><p>"To pick you up. You've finished your exams, so you can consider it graduation. I found you a job running errands in the neighboring district. Your Uncle Guangfeng will take care of you. After gaining some experience for a few years, you can work on your own. If you're lucky, you might earn four to five thousand a month. It's better for you to start working early," Mo Jiaxing said with a beaming smile.</p><p>The world had changed, but Dad was still Dad. Mo Fan could feel the unchangeable warmth of familiarity.</p><p>Mo Jiaxing and Mo Fan had discussed running errands before. Initially thinking he could surprise his father, Mo Fan had to grudgingly accept the harsh reality that he was indeed a dunce.</p><p>But now, he couldn't bear it.</p><p>In this society, cars, phones, computers, and refrigerators were all around. The products of technology hadn't changed one bit due to magic taking over. If he couldn't become a mage, he would end up as a worker in the factories producing these things. Damn, what was the difference from his previous world? He wanted to learn magic!!</p><p>According to the theory that nothing else in this world would change, my talent should also remain unchanged. With more effort in high school, I can catch up with what I missed and still become a true academic... no, a Magic Overlord!</p><p>"Dad, I want to continue studying," Mo Fan remained silent for a long time before finally telling his father, Mo Jia Xing.</p><p>"Didn't you not like learning magic?" Mo Jia Xing raised an eyebrow, saying with a strange expression.</p><p>"Eh..." Mo Fan felt a headache, unsure if his father would believe him if he told the truth. Sigh, it was frustrating.</p><p>Seeing his son who was about to turn sixteen, Mo Jia Xing put on a thick smile and said, "It's fine, Dad won't blame you for not working hard enough at learning magic. Everyone has their own aspirations."</p><p>"No, I really want to learn."</p><p>"Can you pass the exam?" Mo Jia Xing asked.</p><p>"No," Mo Fan answered confidently.</p><p>"So what? It's fine. Although it's often said that all skills are of low rank and only magic is noble, there's also the saying that there can be a top expert in every field..."</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but smack his lips after hearing this.</p><p>Now Mo Fan had to automatically convert a lot of information, which made him particularly speechless. For example, he remembered one day when his history teacher told the class that the founder of light magic was "Edison," and at that moment, millions of goats were galloping in his mind!</p><p>When Mo Jia Xing patted Mo Fan's shoulder to comfort him, he suddenly noticed that his son had remained silent and seemed unusually uneasy.</p><p>A father knows his son best. Mo Jia Xing slowly put away his smile and lowered his voice, "Are you serious?"</p><p>"Yes, I want to get that awakening opportunity. Although I know it's too late to regret now, I really want to study hard and become a magician," Mo Fan said sincerely.</p><p>What he needed was just an opportunity!</p><p>Mo Jia Xing maintained silence for a moment.</p><p>Mo Fan also did not say anything.</p><p>"Really want to learn?" Mo Jiaying confirmed once more.</p><p>"Yes," Mo Fan nodded without any hesitation.</p><p>At first, Mo Fan thought he was dreaming, that the world was playing a joke on him. But facts proved otherwise; the world had truly changed! This wasn’t a dream!</p><p>"Well then, I’ll think of a way," Mo Jiaying did not say anything more.</p><p>"Dad, I found a summer part-time job at Tianlan Magic High School to manage the library. I start working the day after tomorrow," Mo Fan said.</p><p>Since he had decided to learn magic, Mo Fan had to put all his energy into it.</p><p>Whether or not he could attend the magic high school and gain that opportunity for awakening as a magician depended on Dad; however, his lack of knowledge needed to be filled by his own efforts. Therefore, even though he knew there was no hope of getting accepted into the magic high school, Mo Fan had already found this job.</p><p>This job paid almost nothing and only provided food and accommodation, but it was really important to Mo Fan. In the library, he could find a lot of things that he needed to catch up on.</p><p>Fortunately, he truly was a genius; in a short time, he had finished catching up with elementary school grades one and two… Damn, why did this sentence always make him feel like an idiot!</p><p>Beside him, his father Mo Jiaying saw how determined his son was and felt moved.</p><p>Since his son was so eager to seek magic, what reason did he have not to be happy? After all, in this society, only magicians truly had a status. Working in sales for a lifetime with a house and car would still not compare to the value and respect of a magician who graduated from a magic school.</p><p>"Let’s go home first; I’ll take care of this!" Mo Jiaying nodded without saying anything more.</p>
