						<p>Mo Fan looked at this almost twisted guy and couldn't help but find it amusing.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun, who had spared no effort in cultivating a successor for the Big Family of Bog City, turned out to be a dog that the Black Vatican sent to infiltrate him ten years ago. This disaster was meticulously planned!</p><p>No wonder Yuang's superiors got so angry at him, turning him into a monster that wasn't human or ghost. Their meticulously laid plans had ended in failure, and this failure seemed to be due to Mo Fan himself.</p><p>Sigh, what fate!</p><p>Getting back to the matter at hand, there was something about Yuang that resonated with Mo Fan: he also thought Mu Zhuoyun was an old scoundrel.</p><p>"You ignorant little brat! Ruining my plans, tarnishing my reputation—today I will make you taste tenfold, a hundredfold pain!!" Yuang roared in anger.</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but sneer, his gaze fixed on Yuang and his black monster: "A defeated subordinate, even if you have one more black monster… ****!"</p><p>Before Mo Fan could finish speaking, several deformed black figures appeared behind Yuang. This made Mo Fan no longer have the leisure to waste time with this insane fellow; he bolted towards the elevator entrance!</p><p>While running, a fireball formed in Mo Fan's palm.</p><p>Not daring to think too much, Mo Fan directly launched the exploding fireball at the mall entrance, buying himself some time to escape.</p><p>The fireball exploded violently at the door. The sheer power of the explosion had tremendous destructive force on the black monsters, and with the flying shards of broken glass, those few black monsters naturally couldn't catch up with Mo Fan immediately.</p><p>A chaotic scene ensued, scattered glass fragments and sparks everywhere. Yuang used his magical shield to block the blast's impact and then glanced at the few black monsters rolling on the ground trying to extinguish their flames.</p><p>His eyes were as cruel as ever; he would not stop until Mo Fan was dead!</p><p>He raised his hand, and several dark shadows emerged from beneath the stairs in quick succession. These shadows moved incredibly fast, quickly gathering around Yuang under his command, like a hunting pack.</p><p>Ten black monsters gathered around Yuang, clearly showing how determined he was to kill Mo Fan.</p><p>To know, this group of black beast demons dispatched to him by Shalang was instructed to guard the demon entrance. However, upon seeing Mo Fan, Yu Ang had already lost all sense of reason and intended to kill him thoroughly!!</p><p>"Yu Ang, return to me immediately! A team of mages is approaching the demon entrance!" Just as Yu Ang was about to savor this revenge banquet, he heard a voice from the eagle-nosed man in his earpiece.</p><p>Yu Ang was extremely furious; he had wanted to witness these black beast demons tear Mo Fan apart alive with his own eyes.</p><p>"Alright, I will go right away." Yu Ang did not dare to disobey. If Lord Shalang found out, it would not be a matter of destroying the other half of his face; that man was the scariest person Yu Ang had ever encountered in his life.</p><p>Yu Ang cast a vicious glance at Mo Fan, who had fled to the elevator entrance and was slowly climbing up an inactive elevator. He could not help but smile cruelly again.</p><p>"Black beast demons are experts at tracking. Once they catch you, they will peel your skin off piece by piece, extract each of your bones, and dig out all your organs. So, enjoy it well; there is no way you can escape from these ten black beast demons!!" Yu Ang laughed mockingly at Mo Fan's hasty retreat.</p><p>His laughter gradually faded away, clearly believing that with Mo Fan's abilities, he was absolutely unable to handle ten black beast demons that worked together to hunt.</p><p>In fact, the combat strength of black beast demons fell between giant-eyed squirrels and one-eyed demon wolves. They were much more terrifying in ambushes and tracking than those two creatures. Ten black beast demons working together in an offensive would be more terrifying than ten one-eyed demon wolves, and Yu Ang had given them a direct order to chase Mo Fan until they ruthlessly killed him!</p><p>Mo Fan did not dare to delay for a moment.</p><p>Yu Ang alone was not what he feared; with one black beast demon added to Yu Ang, Mo Fan still had some leeway. However, ten black beast demons were completely beyond his ability to resist.</p><p>Rushing to the elevator area, Mo Fan forcefully pried open the elevator door.</p><p>The elevator was clearly at the bottom floor. Mo Fan decisively jumped into the nearly suspended elevator shaft and then quickly climbed up the cable hanging down from the shaft.</p><p>Mo Fan's physical fitness was decent, and his climbing speed was not slow.</p><p>However, after climbing only about three meters, a horrible scream sounded below, which was one black beast demon also jumping into the pitch-black elevator shaft...</p><p>The space within the elevator shaft was limited. The black beast demon did not grab the cable and fell directly to the bottom of the elevator shaft, landing on the partition that stopped at the basement level, suffering a heavy impact.</p><p>Soon after, the second black beast demon also jumped in.</p><p>With the lesson from the previous one that had simply fallen, this black beast demon actually managed to grab onto the cable with its claws and climbed swiftly upward using its strong forelimbs.</p><p>"Damnit, get down here!" Mo Fan cursed.</p><p>Saying so, he gripped the cable tightly, and arcs of electricity rapidly passed through his fingertips and transmitted along the clearly exposed cable.</p><p>The electric current quickly spread downward. The black beast demon, which had almost grabbed Mo Fan with its claws, suffered an unexpected shock. Its forelimbs retracted visibly...</p><p>"Screech~~~~~~~~~~~!"</p><p>The black beast demon emitted a scream as it fell swiftly down, landing precisely on the first black beast demon that was attempting to climb up the cable.</p><p>Mo Fan heaved a sigh of relief and quickly climbed upward again.</p><p>However, after passing through the outer layer of the reinforced glass elevator, Mo Fan discovered that these black beast demons actually possessed some intelligence. Upon realizing that Mo Fan could use lightning power to force them to stop climbing, these black beast demons did something that made Mo Fan curse inwardly—they simply took the stairs!</p><p>Most large shopping malls are equipped with both escalators and elevators. They left four of the black beast demons at the elevator entrance, guarding Mo Fan who had taken refuge in the reinforced glass elevator shaft. The remaining six charged collectively toward an escalator in another direction, clearly aiming to block off floors 2 and 3 where Mo Fan would be.</p><p>Although they might find it difficult to destroy the reinforced glass of the elevator shaft, they could probably pry open the elevator doors, which if sealed from above and below, would surely spell doom for Mo Fan.</p><p>Therefore, as soon as he reached the second floor, Mo Fan immediately pried open the elevator door on that level and dashed toward an emergency exit, where he had a plan!</p>
