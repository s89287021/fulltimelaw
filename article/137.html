						<p>Following the time Tang Yue had provided, Mo Fan arrived at the country's most renowned magic association.</p><p>The grandeur of the initial plaza could already be felt from afar, a far cry from the small branch office of the Magic Association in Bocai City.</p><p>People moving up and down the staircase looked no different from ordinary folks, but just by their aura, one could tell they were all mages—some weaker than him, some on par with him, and others whose presence he couldn't sense at all.</p><p>Those who didn't exude any magical aura were undoubtedly beyond his level!</p><p>No wonder it was the most prestigious magic association in the country. High-level mages, whom one could only see as gods in Bocai City, could also be found here... Oh, those people were tourists, not mages.</p><p>He walked through the exhibition hall that combined modernity and historical significance and took the elevator up to a height of one hundred meters.</p><p>This floor was known as the lower hemisphere, where mages gathered. Although it did have tourist floors, it mainly served mages from all over the country.</p><p>Exiting the elevator, he saw a magnificent grand hall stretching before him. The building itself was a spherical structure with a diameter reaching fifty meters. Upon raising his head to see the Renaissance-style arched dome and magic murals, he felt an overwhelming sense of mystical magic emanating from it.</p><p>"Is there anything I can assist you with, noble Mage Sir?" the receptionist, dressed in a flowing white cheongsam, asked with a smile.</p><p>"I am here for my awakening. Someone has made a reservation for me," Mo Fan said, his eyes involuntarily glancing at the beautiful long legs exposed by the cheongsam. Wow, big cities are indeed different; even the hostess is so beautiful!</p><p>"Let me check that for you. May I ask your name...?"</p><p>"Mo Fan."</p><p>"Oh, thank you, Mr. Mo Fan. Would you like to take a look around here or should I directly escort you to the Awakening Room?" the girl asked with a smile.</p><p>"Just take me to the Awakening Room."</p><p>Compared to sightseeing, Mo Fan cared more about awakening.</p><p>Having experienced so many things, Mo Fan clearly understood how important having another system was!</p><p>After passing through the lobby, Mo Fan discovered an interesting phenomenon: there were actually many one-on-one seating areas set up in the lobby. Some magicians enjoyed personalized service from a lobby attendant, while a large number of magicians sat on the chairs in the lobby, staring intently at the huge LCD screen ahead, searching for the information they wanted.</p><p>"The big screen will announce some bounties and resources distributed by the Magic Association this week. Those who need it can apply..." The girl seemed to notice that Mo Fan was a first-time visitor and explained kindly.</p><p>"What about the one-on-one service?" asked Mo Fan.</p><p>"They either paid a hefty price for such privileges or have already reached the intermediate level of mages. Intermediate-level mages automatically enjoy one-on-one service. Any items they wish to trade will be appraised by the staff, who will suggest how to sell them. Or if there are suitable bounties, detailed information will be compiled and provided to these types of mages. Additionally, events that need attention and services that require application will all be handled on their behalf, saving time while eliminating many cumbersome procedures. Of course, according to the staff's expertise, they can obtain information that ordinary people cannot," explained the girl in a qipao with great thoroughness.</p><p>"So it is like this." Mo Fan nodded his head.</p><p>Everyone hopes to have privileges, but only a few possess them... Yes, I am one of the few!</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan was brought into countless perfectly round rooms, and the dense array of awakening spheres left him dizzy.</p><p>"Mr. Guo, t-that magician who is about to awaken has arrived," the qipao-clad girl stammered when she reached there.</p><p>"Oh, I see. Let him sit over there," said Mr. Guo, who seemed to be busy and spoke without much emotion.</p><p>"T-Then I'll leave," the qipao-clad girl glanced at Mr. Guo secretly, her face showing some disappointment as she left.</p><p>Mo Fan sat down beside Mr. Guo as instructed, waiting with some excitement, just like during his first awakening on the school playground back then.</p><p>On the other side, Mr. Guo did not even glance at Mo Fan and walked into another room on his own.</p><p>The room was somewhat dim. Mr. Guo looked at his female apprentice and asked, "Xiao Mian, is the awakening stone ready?"</p><p>"What type of guiding stone is this?" the apprentice named Xiaomian asked.</p><p>"I'll take a look..." Guo Liyu walked to the door and glanced at Mo Fan from a distance, too lazy to ask him. He sounded somewhat impatient as he said, "It's a thunder-type."</p><p>"Don't you want to ask??" Xiaomian said.</p><p>"How much did Master take from him?" Xiaomian asked timidly.</p><p>"One hundred thousand. The probability of awakening the thunder-type is only slightly higher than normal circumstances," Guo Liyu replied.</p><p>Xiaomian's mouth opened in shock.</p><p>Just to help someone increase their chance of awakening a thunder-type by a little, and Master took one hundred thousand! Master is so heartless!</p><p>Of course, Xiaomian didn't dare say anything more. She placed the thunder-type guiding stone slowly around the great awakening stone.</p><p>Our Awakening House, located at the largest Magic Association, uses the highest quality awakening stones, with generally high charges. We only offer free services to those introduced by some special individuals.</p><p>"Kid, come in. I need to tell you that what you awaken is determined by fate and your own bloodline. Even with a guiding stone, the success rate is only slightly higher. So if you end up awakening a light-type or water-type, don't blame me," Guo Liyu walked to Mo Fan's side, his face showing that he wasn't in a good mood.</p><p>"I understand, can we start then?" Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Go inside. We won't disturb you during the awakening process..." Xiaomian, for some reason unfriendly towards Mo Fan, said.</p>
