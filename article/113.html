						<p>The black beast demon ran at a swift pace, but it had to circle around a large area to chase Mo Fan up to the second floor via the escalator and then circle back again to reach the elevator entrance. This took more time, giving Mo Fan some breathing room. He seized this opportunity to dash into the emergency staircase.</p><p>Mo Fan sprinted down the emergency staircase.</p><p>In his memory, the shopping mall had a very secure control room on the third floor. When he visited with Xinxia to shop and went looking for a restroom, he nearly stumbled upon someone else’s control room. The materials there were much thicker than those of other rooms. If he could hide in there, the black beast demon wouldn’t be able to harm him in the short term.</p><p>In summary, every moment counted!</p><p>Of course, most importantly, Mo Fan wanted to use the control room to find Xinxia.</p><p>The control room was actually a surveillance room. If all the cameras in the shopping mall were functioning properly, their feeds would be displayed there, and the main control room usually had its own power generator. The cameras should still work even if the mall lost power.</p><p>He ran all the way up to the third floor, where the main control room wasn’t far from the emergency staircase. As Mo Fan reached the door, he could already hear the rapid footsteps and greedy breathing of those damned black beast demons approaching from the stairwell, along with clashing noises as they knocked over objects.</p><p>"Thank goodness the door isn't locked," Mo Fan immediately saw the control room and boldly rushed in before quickly shutting the door.</p><p>The thick iron door had just been securely locked when a heavy dent suddenly appeared on it, accompanied by loud vibrations. Clearly, one of the black beast demons had collided with the door directly.</p><p>No one was left in the control room. At a glance, Mo Fan identified a camera near the main control room on the third floor. Through the screen, he was horrified to see that all ten black beast demons were gathered outside the door, trying every means possible to break through the room.</p><p>The black beast demon shouldn’t be able to break through this iron door in the short term. Mo Fan’s gaze quickly scanned the area.</p><p>In front of him were numerous surveillance computer screens resembling a hive of bees, allowing him to see almost the entire shopping mall, including the Walmart supermarket on the basement level.</p><p>The supermarket was large, and with rows upon rows of shelves blocking his view in many places, it seemed he couldn’t see anyone at first glance...</p><p>Wait, there’s movement!</p><p>Suddenly, through the overhead camera, Mo Fan saw something slowly crawling out, seemingly from the Walmart warehouse area.</p><p>Mo Fan quickly found the Walmart warehouse's surveillance footage and was shocked to discover that a giant-eyed porcupine, covered in blood, had drilled out of one of the sewage pipes! The underworld was the den of the giant-eyed porcupines, and whenever there was an opening, they would drill up to the land. Clearly, two giant-eyed porcupines had entered Walmart through that sewage pipe.</p><p>"Thank goodness Xinxia wasn't here; otherwise, she would be in danger... Xinxia, where are you?" Mo Fan continued searching but still couldn't find any sign of her.</p><p>When he scanned the Walmart surveillance footage for a second time, Mo Fan suddenly locked onto a wheelchair parked beside a large drink freezer!!</p><p>Mo Fan immediately widened his eyes, trying to zoom in on the surveillance footage.</p><p>This operation wasn't too difficult. Mo Fan quickly found what he was looking for. Upon zooming in, he became even more convinced that it was Xinxia's wheelchair!</p><p>Xinxia wasn't on the wheelchair!!</p><p>Mo Fan felt as if his heart had been pierced by something, his mind racing with confusion.</p><p>Could she...</p><p>"Hmm, what is this??"</p><p>Just when he was reeling from the shock, Mo Fan noticed something moving inside the large freezer beside the wheelchair.</p><p>Mo Fan quickly turned his attention to another surveillance screen and zoomed in again.</p><p>On the screen, Mo Fan was astounded to see that within the freezer, which originally held frozen dairy products, there was a black-haired girl in a simple dress curled up.</p><p>The wheelchair was nearby, but there was someone hiding inside the freezer. She must be Xinxia, she had to be. Despite not being able to see her face clearly, Mo Fan was quite certain at this moment!</p><p>That's great, that's wonderful.</p><p>She was alone in the Walmart supermarket, it was clear that she had been abandoned there by the group who had escaped from Walmart earlier.</p><p>Fortunately, she was left behind here; otherwise, she would have met the same grim fate as the others under the fangs of the giant-eyed gorillas.</p><p>However, Mo Fan was far from feeling relieved. Especially when he saw those two bloodstained giant-eyed gorillas entering the dairy section where Ye Xinxia was hiding through the surveillance camera, his heart began to pound rapidly.</p><p>Imagine this: inside a freezer lay the person most important to him, and just outside were two giant-eyed gorillas capable of ending her life instantly. This scene played out before his very eyes on the monitor. With nothing left but gritted teeth and silent prayers, the tension and anxiety intensified, making every hair on his body stand on end!!</p><p>His heart raced uncontrollably as he stared intently at the surveillance screen.</p><p>At that moment, Mo Fan wished he could rush down there to blast those giant-eyed gorillas getting closer and closer to the freezer into pieces.</p><p>However, Mo Fan was in no better position. Outside that door were ten black beasts of similar strength to the giant-eyed gorillas trying to break through the iron gate. The only thing left to do seemed to be just watching helplessly.</p><p>No way, he couldn’t let this happen!!</p><p>Whether it was his own perilous situation or Ye Xinxia’s desperate struggle for survival, relying solely on prayers and waiting would surely lead to certain death.</p><p>The door would soon be breached.</p><p>Ye Xinxia could not hide indefinitely in that cold freezer without oxygen; she might suffocate inside that extremely cold dairy freezer!</p><p>Those two giant-eyed gorillas had not detected Ye Xinxia hiding in the freezer, but they were clearly intent on enjoying their feast at the meat counter. They would not leave Walmart anytime soon, and Ye Xinxia could not hide in that freezer for more than half an hour!</p><p>She was already trembling uncontrollably!</p><p>To prevent her body temperature from being detected by these cold-blooded giant-eyed gorillas, she had entered a very cold freezer, where frost covered the entire area!</p><p>Seeing Heartxia’s helpless state in Walmart, witnessing her shivering and curling up in the freezer for survival, Mo Fan’s heart was breaking.</p><p>He had promised to protect her no matter what, yet he still let her suffer such torment and agony.</p><p>He clenched his teeth hard, but he did not realize that he had bitten his lip to a pulp.</p><p>He gripped his fist tightly.</p><p>He knew very well that waiting any longer would only bring Ye Xinxia closer to death.</p><p>Finally, Mo Fan suddenly sat down and shut his eyes tightly!!</p><p>"Little Mud Fish, I let you absorb all the Earth Saint Springs... now, I will use every ounce of my strength to break through. Please give me all the energy you can provide!!" Mo Fan seemed to be speaking to Little Mud Fish, but he was also fiercely speaking to himself!</p><p>Previously, in the earth hall, Mo Fan had attempted to advance to a high-rank mage multiple times without success.</p><p>This time, he would rely on the power of Little Mud Fish.</p><p>The Earth Saint Springs were indeed consumed, and Mo Fan did not lie about that. It was just that it was not Mo Fan himself who drank them; they were completely absorbed by Little Mud Fish.</p><p>Mo Fan now had to break through his cultivation level in this short span of time.</p><p>But this time, he could no longer afford to fail!!!</p><p>————————————</p><p>(You guys didn't notice, did you? It's already July 1st, and the book hasn't gone up for a paid release???)</p>
