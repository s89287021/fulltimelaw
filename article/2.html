						<p>This is a residential area surrounding Half-City Mountain, and if you follow the road lined with iron railings, you will eventually reach the end of the alley where Mo Fan's house is located. </p><p>It is a small building, only one and a half stories high, with peeling paint revealing red bricks, surrounded by various debris.</p><p>Most of the neighboring houses have been renovated to three and a half floors, looking more like homes; in contrast, Mo Fan's humble and dilapidated house at the corner stands out even more.</p><p>"Hey, Mo Fan! You're back... I've got some good news for you," said a boy who looked as mischievous as a mud monkey the moment he reached the doorstep, his face brimming with joy.</p><p>This mischievous boy is named Zhang Hou and grew up in this old neighborhood alongside Mo Fan.</p><p>"What's the good news?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"The Little Princess has returned! I saw her at the entrance to the villa today. Wow, you have no idea how beautiful she looks now; she's like a little angel," said Zhang Hou excitedly.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at the villa directly across the street. The villa boasts lush greenery that the entire city envies, with every inch of land meticulously landscaped into a true botanical garden.</p><p>However, the beautiful City Mountain Garden is now enclosed by high-speed rail fences.</p><p>When he was young, there were no fences, and he often brought the children from this street to play in the villa gardens.</p><p>At the highest point of the villa are several exquisitely designed European villas, which seemed like castles from fairy tales to this bunch of naughty kids. And indeed, a princess lived in the castle who was beautiful enough to make one forget how to breathe, about their age; Mo Fan often brought a group of children to kidnap and play with her...</p><p>But at some point, fences were added around the villa, and the adults on the street no longer allowed children to enter. The princess, once part of their games, became a real castle inhabitant, growing out of reach as she aged, making appearances less frequent.</p><p>"Do you know? I heard that the Little Princess is now a magic genius at an elite high school in the capital city, possessing unparalleled ability in ice magic and capable of casting it at just 15 years old," Zhang Hou whispered mysteriously.</p><p>Mo Fan was stunned. If Zhang Hou told him that the Little Princess had won some national olympiad award, he would probably have felt nothing, but an ice mage was truly remarkable!</p><p>Most people only awaken to their first magic element, typically in their first year of high school at age 16.</p><p>After obtaining it, that does not mean you are a magician. You still need to undergo very long years of cultivation and obtain the Book of Magic, practice diligently before you can release a spell. This little princess is truly remarkable; she became a true magician at just 15!</p><p>Could this be what they call a prodigy? A prodigy in the world of magic!</p><p>"Big Brother Mo, I really feel sorry for you. Back then, if you had put in a bit more effort, who knows, you might have won over that innocent little princess. She is beautiful and talented; hmm… we envy her so much," Zhang Xiaohou said with raised eyebrows.</p><p>"That childhood nonsense, forget about it," Mo Fan ignored him.</p><p>Mo Jiaxing, hearing these two teenagers talk, coughed and took Mo Fan home.</p><p>As soon as they got home, Dad Mo Jiaxing said, "I’ll be out for a bit. Xiatian is staying at Auntie’s place; she shouldn’t be coming back."</p><p>"Alright, I understand."</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Jiaxing hurriedly left, and Mo Fan walked around the house, discovering that nothing had changed at all. The family was still destitute as before.</p><p>The world had changed, but not a bit of their poverty in the family. Why didn’t his family switch places with that household on the estate? God really went through a lot of trouble turning science into magic; couldn’t he have taken care of this little detail?</p><p>The only thing worth being grateful for was: his appearance hadn’t changed, and he was still handsome as ever!</p><p>Following a rarely-taken mossy path, just as he was about to turn onto the main street, Mo Fan spotted his dad’s old pickup truck.</p><p>His dad was a driver; previously, he drove for the elderly master of the estate. Later on, he somehow got transferred to logistics, basically helping people at the estate buy things. Since then, their family situation had declined drastically.</p><p>"Jiaxing, your demand is somewhat impolite. You should know that I wasn’t unkind to you in the past. After your son did that, I still kept one procurement person for you; if it were someone else’s, I would have told him to pack up and leave," a slow-spoken middle-aged man said.</p><p>"Brother Mu He, consider this my last request for help. The Tiaolan Magic High School really costs too much money to enroll in. You know our situation; we simply can’t afford it," Mo Jiaxing’s voice came through slowly and apologetically.</p><p>"You, why are you doing this for your useless son? He's not capable of getting into Magic High School on his own, so let him fend for himself. He's almost 16 already. Besides, even if I help you get him into Magic High School this time, with his personality, he'll surely slack off and never become a real mage. Becoming a mage isn't easy; it requires not only innate talent and hard work but also access to magic books, magical artifacts, and tools. Without these, he won't even become an apprentice mage..."</p><p>The man named Mu He said this with a serious tone, but Mo Fan heard arrogance in his voice.</p><p>"He really wants to learn this time. Brother Mu He, if you're willing to help me, I'll immediately move us out of the Mu Family Estate as Mr. Mu suggested earlier. This will make Mr. Mu feel more at ease, and I guarantee that my son won't bother Miss Mu Ningxue anymore," Mo Jiaxing's voice echoed.</p><p>"Oh, this is something to consider."</p><p>Upon hearing their willingness to leave, the man named Mu He seemed interested in continuing the conversation.</p><p>...</p><p>Against the wall, a teenager leaned against it, his mood becoming incredibly complex as he listened to the dialogue.</p><p>He thought the world had changed, that many terrifying relationships would alter. But apparently... nothing had changed at all.</p><p>The wealthy residents of Musan Mansion, like rulers, remained above everyone else. His father, struggling at the bottom, still had to crawl and beg everywhere. Mu He was the chairman behind Tianlan Magic High School; he could easily get him into the school with just a word. </p><p>But when he heard his father Mo Jiaxing agree to move out of the Mu Family Estate, Mu He seemed relieved and quickly agreed.</p><p>In the end, the conversation ended with Mo Jiaxing's endless thanks to Mu He, who then left in his luxury car, leaving behind an old, solitary pickup truck battered by the dust—just like his father, Mo Jiaxing.</p><p>Was this a dream?</p><p>It was as cruel as reality. Mo Fan, breathing heavily against the wall, clearly realized that nothing had changed about his family situation or their humble status.</p><p>Something surged violently in his heart, and he clenched his fist, pounding it heavily against the greenish wall.</p><p>Certainly, certainly, you must remember to vote for the "Recommendation Ticket" and definitely "Add to Bookshelf." The new book, "Full-Time Mage," is set to open a splendid curtain!</p><p>Let your passion rise even higher, let me know how much you love competition, how much you adore Uncle Lu, and how much of that fervor will carry over to "Full-Time Mage"!!</p><p>Brothers of the Chaotic Alliance, I am calling for you!</p><p>Bomb away!!!</p>
