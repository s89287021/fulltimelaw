						<p>Pushing Xinxia out of the square, Mo Fan immediately saw those black beast demons crawling in agony. Among them, three seemed to have been gnawed on by other creatures, their bodies broken into several pieces. The few that had managed to survive had fled elsewhere, but injured demons were actually more appetizing to other demons than humans; they would probably be eaten clean before they could go far.</p><p>Demons in the wild inherently engaged in mutual slaughter, as their bodies contained energy similar to mana stones. Many demons even fought each other to the death for the carcasses of higher-ranking creatures.</p><p>"We'll reach Jamai Overpass, then returning to the safety boundary will be much safer," Mo Fan said to Xinxia.</p><p>"Hmm." Xinxia nodded, but there was a hint of worry on her face.</p><p>Mo Fan smiled slightly and told Xinxia, "Don't worry, we won't encounter any demons."</p><p>Xinxia looked at Mo Fan somewhat bewildered.</p><p>There were clearly demons all around them, so why did he say they wouldn't meet any? Such comforting words seemed too far-fetched to be true?</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan pushed Xinxia directly onto the main road.</p><p>He walked and stopped intermittently, sometimes suddenly speeding up, and other times searching for places to hide...</p><p>His seemingly nonsensical actions always managed to avoid the demons wandering nearby, making Xinxia feel as though someone was using a satellite map to guide Mo Fan.</p><p>Continuing forward, they indeed encountered no obstacles. Occasionally, a few demons would dart past, but it seemed they were wary of something and often chose to detour around.</p><p>Xinxia watched all this unfold. After walking through several streets continuously, she finally couldn't help but ask, "Big Brother Mo Fan, why are they actually so afraid of you?"</p><p>Indeed, those wandering, scattered demons would deliberately avoid them even when they saw them, which did not match the cannibalistic nature of demons. Moreover, Xinxia could sense a hint of panic in their eyes.</p><p>"That's because they're not too stupid and sensed that the aura on my body is stronger than theirs," Mo Fan said with a smile.</p><p>"Breath stronger than theirs?" Xin Xia lowered her head and thought for a moment. A few seconds later, she suddenly realized something and her beautiful face broke into an enchanting smile. "Brother Mo Fan is already...a mid-rank mage???"</p><p>"No mistake, hahaha, if these little demons don't form a group now, coming to us would be like walking to their deaths!!" Mo Fan laughed so brightly.</p><p>There was indeed a huge difference between the initial and mid-ranks. When entering the shopping plaza earlier, he had been extremely cautious, step by step, fearing that he might disturb any demon ancestors.</p><p>Now, Mo Fan walked past them with great confidence; they probably wouldn't dare to attack him. If they did try, he would definitely kill them in one shot.</p><p>Of course, Mo Fan wasn't looking for trouble either.</p><p>In fact, his mid-rank magic hadn't been fully mastered yet; he could only release it thanks to the four Star Chart books sent by his beautiful teacher, Tang Yue.</p><p>Mo Fan had already burned two of them and was holding onto the other two Star Chart books, meaning he could use mid-rank magic at most two more times. With the consumption of mana, Mo Fan wouldn't go out of his way to provoke them either.</p><p>"So that's it, then Brother Mo Fan's perception has also become much stronger?" Xin Xia asked happily.</p><p>"Hmm, I can detect any movements of demons around me, even if they are a few streets away," Mo Fan said.</p><p>Mid-rank mages already had the ability of mind sensing. This sense not only allowed them to quickly detect unusual movements nearby but could also rapidly sniff out fluctuations in energy.</p><p>If someone wanted to ambush and happened to be within a mid-rank mage's mind-sensing range, the mage could immediately react.</p><p>This was much stronger than an initial-rank mage!!</p><p>Xin Xia's joy was reflected on her face. Her rosy, excited appearance was extremely cute, making people want to kiss her on the spot.</p><p>Just as Xin Xia was about to speak, she suddenly noticed Mo Fan frown and become very serious.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Xin Xia asked quietly.</p><p>"Damn it, I hope no demons are forming a group to cause trouble for me. Let's hide first," Mo Fan cursed.</p><p>Mo Fan pushed Xin Xia and hurried into a nearby corridor. </p><p>Without waiting for Xin Xia to say anything, Mo Fan directly picked her up and quickly ran towards the top of the floor. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, Mo Fan would certainly take a good sniff of Xin Xia's distinctive body scent and perhaps rub against her waist a bit. But now he did not dare to have any lascivious thoughts; he had already sensed that there was a large group of demons nearby.</p><p>These demons were running at extremely high speeds. By the time Mo Fan reached the middle of the building, he could hear the rumbling sounds coming from the streets not far away.</p><p>Mo Fan carried Xin Xia all the way to the fifth floor and saw through the corridor windows that an unimaginable number of demons had appeared on the nearby streets!</p><p>One-eyed wolf demons, giant-eyed rat demons—these ferocious creatures rushed in like a tide, quickly filling those few streets, and seemed to be frantically chasing after something.</p><p>Xin Xia was tightly held by Mo Fan, not daring to breathe even a bit.</p><p>She could also feel the overwhelming aura of the nearby demons. If they were discovered, even an intermediate-level mage would be swallowed up by this tidal wave of demons.</p><p>"It's Instructor Lu and company!" Mo Fan finally made out the group of people fleeing wildly down the street.</p><p>On that long street, Instructor Luo Yunbo was riding on a wind track through the chaotic road, with Female Instructor Pan Lijun hanging onto his hand.</p><p>Meanwhile, another military mage was desperately fleeing on another street, carrying the person who was running—the captain of the demon-hunting team, Xu Dahuang.</p><p>From Mo Fan's position, he could see Mingwen Girls' High School. Looking in that direction, it was clear that there had been a significant collapse at Mingwen Girls' High School, especially where the cafeteria used to be. The cafeteria and playground were gone, replaced by a huge crater.</p><p>"They succeeded!" Mo Fan felt overjoyed.</p><p>The demon entrance in this Mingwen District was very large. Destroying it would mean completely stopping the advance of the demon army, and thus preserving Bocity!</p><p>Where was Colonel Cheng??</p><p>Mo Fan quickly noticed that all the people in the team had disappeared, leaving only those four being pursued by a horde of demons. Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun were clearly being sandwiched by the demons and would be swallowed up soon.</p><p>Are they all dead??? Mo Fan's face showed a touch of helplessness. Indeed, this was a one-way mission; even Captain Cheng, such an intermediate-level mage, had perished there. "Xin Xia, let's go to the rooftop..." Mo Fan picked up Xin Xia and ran towards the rooftop of the building. They were heroes of Bo City; no matter what, Mo Fan could not stand by and watch them die!</p>
