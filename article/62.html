						<p>Yu Ang diligently practiced for himself, even though his foster father Zhuo Yun arranged a magic duel for him a year later. Yu Ang genuinely did not give much thought to it.</p><p>"Go ahead first, I'll be right there," Mu He said.</p><p>Yu Ang nodded and headed towards the master's bedroom.</p><p>Passing through an artificial garden, Yu Ang entered a quaint little courtyard.</p><p>In such an estate dominated by European style, the appearance of a traditional tea house seemed somewhat strange.</p><p>"Father, I don't quite understand why you arranged such a boring duel for me," Yu Ang sat to one side and said to Mu Zhuo Yun.</p><p>"Then you should arrange a more suitable opponent for me," Yu Ang said.</p><p>"At first, I also thought that having such a minor role as an opponent at your coming-of-age ceremony was somewhat frivolous. I was considering what more appropriate arrangements could be made, but now it doesn't seem like that anymore; it might even be a good chance for me, Deng Kai, and Principal Zhu to have a secret showdown," Mu Zhuo Yun said.</p><p>"How so?" Yu Ang asked in confusion.</p><p>"Your opponent, Mo Fan, has already mastered the second level of Fire Infusion. His cultivation speed exceeded everyone's expectations, achieving such results in just one year is no minor feat. He is now the most outstanding student at Tianlan Magic High School and is closely monitored by Deng Kai, Zhan Kong, and Principal Zhu. Now, even if I want to play some tricks on this brat, these few people might not let me do as I wish... I must say, I was truly surprised that this chauffeur's son's cultivation is no slower than the outstanding disciples of our major clans. If he weren't so out of place. As for what's happening between me and Deng Kai, you don't need to know about it for now," Mu Zhuo Yun said with a cold smile.</p><p>"Given that, it might be more interesting," Yu Ang seemed much more at ease.</p><p>Having a weak opponent at his coming-of-age ceremony would not establish his authority but rather give such scoundrels an unfair advantage. It would also fail to demonstrate his overwhelming strength compared to his peers.</p><p>The Mu family, this major clan, values the coming-of-age ceremonies of their younger generations the most. The coming-of-age ceremony is their grandest ritual. If young heirs could dominate their peers with overwhelming advantages, it would also showcase the absolute power of the Mu family, rather than having the elders who have long held control over Bo City come out to show off.</p><p>Mu Ningxue was in the capital city, excelling in a higher sphere.</p><p>Bo City needed outstanding and flag-bearing young mages as well?</p><p>Yuan Ang is a very promising successor, and Mu Zhuoyun wants to carefully cultivate him, allowing him to establish himself in Bog City. Whether the future road will be smooth naturally depends on how this beginning unfolds. Other offspring can settle their coming-of-age ceremonies internally, but Yuan Ang's ceremony must be grand and spectacular, with guests invited, making a remarkable impression! </p><p>Mo Fan, that boy, is somewhat unexpected.</p><p>He is merely a stepping stone in Yuan Ang's path to power! </p><p>Of course, the shrewd Mu Zhuoyun will not tell Yuan Ang that by investing so many resources into cultivating and recommending him, Yuan Ang will only be another stepping stone for someone else in the future, regardless of how glorious or powerful he becomes. That person is his biological daughter—Mu Ningxue!</p><p>Mu Ningxue is Mu Zhuoyun's perfect successor, but Bog City is too small a pool. Only by nurturing another trusted subordinate can they control Bog City's substantial assets.</p><p>"Rest assured, on the day your coming-of-age ceremony ends, I will activate the Sacred Spring of Bog City for you. You will have an entire week to train inside. This one week alone will be enough for your cultivation level to soar dramatically. You won't need to consider anyone of your peers in Bog City anymore!" Mu Zhuoyun said with a benevolent smile.</p><p>"Father, is the Sacred Spring truly that miraculous?" Yuan Ang asked with sparkling eyes.</p><p>"It certainly is. You should know about stardust magic artifacts; this Sacred Spring is like an enhanced version of them countless times over. It not only alleviates training fatigue but also accelerates your cultivation speed under its nourishment, making it a holy land for training. Whether you meditate or control elements within the Sacred Spring, it will be perfect. The Sacred Spring cannot be activated at will; once you enter, you must focus entirely on training because this might be your best opportunity to advance to a mid-rank mage," Mu Zhuoyun explained.</p><p>"M-Mid rank? Am I still too far away?" Yuan Ang said in surprise.</p><p>"If you hadn't entered the Sacred Spring, you would indeed be too far away, but obtaining this chance may change that," Mu Zhuoyun said, stroking his eight-part beard.</p><p>"Father, how did the Sacred Spring of Bog City come to be? Why does it have such remarkable effects?"</p><p>"The Sacred Spring has a significant origin; you don't need to know. What you must remember is that activating the Sacred Spring is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for exceptional training," Mu Zhuoyun didn't elaborate further.</p><p>Yuan Ang nodded emphatically.</p><p>Clearly, breaking through from the initial stage to becoming a mid-rank mage, so long desired by countless individuals, this Sacred Spring of Bog City is crucial!</p>
