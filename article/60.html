						<p>"Fireblast!"</p><p>Xu Dahan roared, and the intensely powerful flame in his hand pierced through the school's eerie night, glaringly flying towards the giant-eyed rat.</p><p>The giant-eyed rat felt the heat behind it and instinctively tried to dodge to the side.</p><p>This action of the giant-eyed rat slightly startled Mo Fan; this thing was actually so sensitive. Captain Xu Dahan had already released the fireblast at an incredibly fast speed but was still detected by it.</p><p>This fireblast was clearly going to miss. Demons were obviously not like the wooden dummies in the school, standing there for mages to attack.</p><p>"Dodge?"</p><p>"Does that work?"</p><p>Xu Dahan's voice was full of mockery.</p><p>The fireblast had already landed at the giant-eyed rat's previous position and it was obvious that it missed the rat.</p><p>"Explosion!"</p><p>Finally, Xu Dahan fiercely spat out the suffix of the skill.</p><p>Instantly, the fireblast that was about to burn quietly in the air emitted a scorching flame. A small ball of fire could be seen exploding there!!</p><p>"Boom~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!"</p><p>A blazing fireball had an explosive effect. The powerful wave of flames spread magnificently from the center where the fireblast landed.</p><p>Red!!</p><p>A three-meter radius was completely engulfed by red. The bursting flames slammed into the giant-eyed rat, which thought it dodged well.</p><p>A tremor appeared in the air, and the blazing flames were blindingly bright!! Mo Fan, shielding his eyes from the firelight, vaguely saw that the giant-eyed rat was engulfed by a crimson red glow. Its fatty body was blown about five meters away, crashing headfirst into the wall of the cafeteria.</p><p>The giant-eyed rat struggled desperately in the corner, completely devoid of its demonic ferocity, having been reduced to nothing more than a severely injured sewer rat.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Mo Fan's mouth formed a huge "O"!</p><p>Wow, that was incredible!</p><p>Fire Surge - Explosion!!</p><p>This immensely domineering explosion effect left no room for maneuvering by the agile giant-eyed rat. Incineration and bone-burning were nothing compared to the direct and violent nature of this explosive impact!</p><p>"Is… is this Fire Surge Level 3??"</p><p>Mo Fan never expected that the captain of this monster-hunting team had already refined his Fire Surge skill to Level 3; the explosion's impact on the giant-eyed rat nearly killed it outright!</p><p>Damn, if I had learned Fire Surge - Explosion when encountering the ghost wolf beast, one skill would have left it half-dead. There would have been no need to run or rely on stalactites! Stalactites aren't everywhere, and demons don't always stand below them, right!</p><p>Wow, that was amazing, truly incredible!</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan's heart surged like the churning flames, filled with excitement.</p><p>Thinking about reaching such a level with his Fire Surge in the future, his enthusiasm for cultivation skyrocketed.</p><p>Mo Fan believed that as long as he mastered Fire Surge - Explosion, Yu Ang wouldn't be able to match him, and old bastard Mu Zhuoyun's face would surely turn red from being slapped!</p><p>Oh my god, I have to get Fire Surge to Level 3 before graduating high school to blind those titanium alloy dog eyes of the Mu Clan!</p><p>The monster-hunting team appeared extremely cautious and experienced. They knew that the Giant-Eyed Raccoon would definitely run away after that explosion, so both Fat Shi and Guo Caitang used their skills to block the raccoon’s path to the cafeteria.</p><p>"Grrr~~~~~~!!!"</p><p>The Giant-Eyed Raccoon let out a roar, completely unexpectedly lunging fiercely at Guo Caitang.</p><p>Guo Caitang was stunned. Her Ice Vines skill had frozen the position where the raccoon would run away; she never thought that this guy still had enough strength to make such a desperate move.</p><p>"Xiao Ke, Water Control, quick!" Captain Xu Dahan’s expression also changed.</p><p>Xiao Ke looked panicky and immediately used her mind to connect to the water system star tracks.</p><p>However, Xiao Ke, who was slightly nervous, was a bit slow, and her Water Control skill could not be released in time.</p><p>Guo Caitang had often faced such dangers; she gritted her teeth and jumped to dodge.</p><p>This did not allow her to completely avoid the Giant-Eyed Raccoon’s attack, but as long as she could avoid vital areas, losing an arm was still better than dying!</p><p>"Thunder Seal · Python Marks!!"</p><p>Just when everyone called out in alarm, a series of purple lightning seals appeared nearby.</p><p>Guo Caitang saw the convulsing Giant-Eyed Raccoon and was slightly stunned before quickly leaping back a few meters. She then looked at the newly recruited Mo Fan with a face full of disbelief, who had a dark expression.</p><p>"Good job, Vaman!"</p><p>"D*mn, is this Giant-Eyed Raccoon a mutant? How could it be more brutal than a one-eyed demon wolf? It still wants to attack even when half crippled and not running away!" Fat Shi said with a look of lingering fear.</p><p>"Everyone, I've told you many times not to be complacent, not to be complacent!! Guo Caitang almost got into trouble... Fortunately, we recruited a Lei Mage today who can paralyze the demons' muscles; otherwise, how could we have stopped this beast from making its final stand?" Captain Xu Dahuang immediately roared.</p><p>"Sorry, sorry, it's me... my fault." Xiaoke stammered out.</p><p>"Apologizing is useless. If someone died, your apology at their grave wouldn't be heard. As the only Water Mage with defensive capabilities in our team, you should always stay alert and keep your star tracks in hand!!" Xu Dahuang roared at Xiaoke angrily.</p><p>Mo Fan was somewhat taken aback.</p><p>He thought Captain Xu Dahuang would just criticize casually but didn't expect him to directly yell at such a cute girl.</p><p>However, Captain Xu Dahuang's roar wasn't unjustified. Mages of different elements played completely different roles in battle, forming a complete monster-hunting team. A fatal mistake in any link could mean not only the loss of one life but potentially the entire team's destruction, as demons killed people almost instantly!</p><p>Xiaoke bit her lip and didn't dare to say another word, clearly aware that she had made a serious mistake.</p><p>Guo Caitang also didn't blame Xiaoke; instead, she still looked at Mo Fan.</p><p>She really thought her life was hanging by a thread just now, only to be saved by this rookie named Thunder!</p><p>Despite how grateful we are for the enthusiastic support from our critics, please remember to subscribe to the official version after it's launched. Don't watch pirated versions and criticize; that would be very unprofessional. Some people might ask if they can criticize after subscribing to the official version? If you still criticize even after subscribing, well, I won't see it, all I see is an increase in subscriptions.</p><p>Also, please bookmark this book more often. Those who call for the removal of the book and refer to it as garbage in their reviews, listen to me: don't remove it. Come at a fixed time every day to criticize; you have to log in and find the book. Although "Full-Time Mage" frequently makes people want to strangle it by being featured on the homepage, with different positions changing daily, it's not easy to find. It's better to bookmark it for convenience.</p><p>Please continue voting for recommendations every day. On a good mood, recommendation votes are like flowers; giving them away leaves fragrance in your hand. On a bad mood, they're like bricks; throwing one makes you feel refreshed!</p><p>Also, don't forget about monthly votes. Monthly votes are just like strength: if you don't ask for it for a week, it's hard to gain anything.</p>
