						<p>It seemed to have no color!</p><p>Mo Fan carefully examined it and found that this system was truly colorless.</p><p>It was transparent!</p><p>You could see through it because you could clearly feel the outline of a cluster of stardust there, but it was nearly transparent. If one had to say it had any color, it would be the occasional glimmer of pale moonlight!</p><p>What kind of system is this??</p><p>Mo Fan was completely baffled!</p><p>...</p><p>"Are you done yet?" Outside the door, the apprentice girl Xiao Mian pushed open the door on her own and found that Mo Fan had long since awakened. She pouted.</p><p>"Get out once you're done; there's another mage recommended by a judge who is about to awaken. You better not... oh, why does your awakening system have no color..."</p><p>The apprentice girl Xiao Mian looked at the Awakening Stone in amazement.</p><p>On the other side, hearing his apprentice's exclamations, Guo Liyu immediately stood up and ran over to take a look at the Awakening Room.</p><p>When he discovered that there was no color on the Awakening Stone and only an occasional shimmer of moonlight, surprise took over his tense face.</p><p>W-What luck does this brat have? He actually awakened—Summoning!</p><p>Most people's first system would awaken as an Elemental System; those who awakened White Magic, Black Magic, or Dimensional Magic Systems were considered God’s favorites. After all, the primary system was the main focus of study and practice, giving mages more time to refine their skills and connections compared to secondary or auxiliary systems.</p><p>Guo Liyu originally thought that if this guy awakened a Lightning System, his family would have to carry him back on a sedan chair. Who knew he suddenly switched to Dark Magic, which didn't work out, only to end up with a Summoning System!</p><p>Statistically, the most common first system awakening was Elemental, followed by Black Magic and White Magic, with Dimensional Magic being the least probable.</p><p>Mages who awakened with Summoning abilities as their primary system were usually treated like treasures by factions if they chose to be so. The value for effort ratio was truly too high.</p><p>"This is the Summoning class... Hmph, brat, your family's ten thousand was well spent." Gu Liyu twitched at the corner of his mouth and said to Mo Fan, who looked stunned.</p><p>Mo Fan's mouth opened wide, looking at Gu Liyu with some disbelief.</p><p>Summoning class, it's really the Summoning class!!</p><p>Mo Fan could never forget the elegant image of Leader Zhan Kong's subordinates riding Heavenly Eagles flying swiftly over Bog City. That seemed to be the Summoning class!!</p><p>He had always imagined one day being able to ride a handsome beast and fly through the city streets, but he never thought he would unexpectedly get so close.</p><p>This happiness came too suddenly. If Tang Yue were here, Mo Fan would risk being silenced just to pick her up and kiss her fiercely.</p><p>Speaking of which, if he told that old rogue Mu Zhuoyun about awakening the Shadow class and the Summoning class, would he pack up his beauty Mu Ningxue and give her to him?</p><p>It seemed quite likely!!</p><p>Where would you find such a quad-class son-in-law??</p><p>...</p><p>"Alright, alright, now that you've awakened, get going quickly. I'm busy." Gu Liyu, who had seen too much, waved his hand and started dismissing guests.</p><p>"Oh, oh, thank you," Mo Fan just wanted to find a place right away to calm down his emotions.</p><p>"Awake in a special class, if you don't work hard, you'll still be garbage. Moreover, you're so old, slower than normal people by who knows how much, there's nothing to get excited about." Gu Liyu said.</p><p>Mo Fan was confused and didn't understand why Gu Liyu called him old.</p><p>Tang Yue had told him that being a middle-rank mage at his age was already very impressive in Shanghai. Did that mean Gu Liyu had even higher standards??</p><p>Well, the Magic City was the Magic City, with outstanding people and spirits. Being a middle-rank mage here wasn't a big deal...</p><p>Mo Fan did not say anything and left directly.</p><p>Just as he walked out the door, that girl in a cheongsam led an older-looking but young man inside.</p><p>Mo Fan paid no attention and "hopped" away.</p><p>...</p><p>Guo Liyu smiled immediately when she saw the man. She greeted him while instructing Xiao Meng to make tea: "Ah, you must be the mid-level mage Tang Yue introduced... Mo Fan, right?"</p><p>The fat man looked confused, pointing at his wrinkled nose: "I'm Yang Dahai."</p><p>"The young man who just left was Mo Fan," the cheongsam girl said hurriedly.</p><p>Both Master Guo Liyu and her apprentice Xiao Meng were gaping at each other, their expressions beyond words.</p><p>After a while, Xiao Meng came back to her senses and weakly said, "Master, did we... get the wrong person?"</p><p>Guo Liyu nodded stiffly: "Seems like it!"</p><p>"Then... then he actually awakened his second element," Xiao Meng said.</p><p>"As expected, the world judges with harshness. Such a young mid-level mage... awakening Summoning as his second element, I Guo Liyu am thoroughly convinced!" Guo Liyu exclaimed.</p><p>The cheongsam girl did not know what was going on between master and apprentice and had to return to the main hall.</p><p>Yang Dahai sat there, confused about the situation.</p><p>"Are you Yang something-or-other who was supposed to awaken the Lightning element?" Guo Liyu glanced at the fat man and asked casually.</p><p>"It's me," Yang Dahai said, shaking his flab.</p><p>"Xiao Mian, take him to the Awakening Room."</p><p>"Master, didn't you ask me to make tea?"</p><p>"What tea are you making? Don't waste my good tea leaves," Gu Li said as he turned away to do his work.</p><p>The fat man, Yang Dahai, was completely stunned.</p><p>How could the smiling face of this Awakened Master just now turn into one that looked like he owed him five million dollars, or perhaps his father didn't give him enough money??</p><p>...</p>
