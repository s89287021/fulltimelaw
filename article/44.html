						<p>The scenery in the valley was beautiful. To the south, there was a palm-shaped lake, and to the north, there was a raised mountain pass. The old lair of the one-eyed wolf monster was located at the mountain pass; from the center of Herb Valley, it could be seen clearly. The leader of this group, of course, was Green Tea... or rather, the deputy class monitor Mu Bai! Mu Bai had successfully won over everyone in the team during this training session, and the girls admired him even more. His contribution to quickly entering Herb Valley was undeniable. "The cave is right there. I thought this reward mission would be tough, but we found our destination!" Zhao Kunsan laughed heartily. Zhao Kunsan joined the top class in the last quarter and successfully teamed up with Mu Bai again. "Be careful; rewards are never that simple," Mu Bai said. As a member of a prominent family, he had seen and experienced much, knowing that rewards were not easily obtained. Led by Mu Bai, the group of 20 climbed up the steep slope to the mountain pass. At the pass, there was a smaller pond with water filling only about half of it. The cave entrance was visible, large enough to resemble an underground passage in a city. Looking inside the cave, they saw pitch-black depths that easily evoked fear of darkness and the unknown. Cold winds blew out from the cave, causing goosebumps all over their bodies. "Maybe we should wait for more people before going in?" He Yu said timidly. "I agree; it looks really scary," Zhao Kunsan also lacked the courage.</p><p>Who knows what lies within this cave, going in blindly like this...</p><p>If there really are demons, we might not survive.</p><p>Just as everyone was discussing, another group was approaching the mountain entrance from below.</p><p>"It looks like Group Three, that's great!" He Yu said excitedly.</p><p>Groups One and Three were considered to be the most combat-capable among the five groups due to Mu Bai and Xu Zhao Ting's relationship.</p><p>Seeing that Group Three was still much slower than they were, Mu Bai couldn't help but sneer. Although Xu Zhao Ting and Mo Fan, who both had S ratings in their annual evaluations, were in the same group, it didn't matter; practically speaking, he, who had been nurtured by a noble family, was still far more capable.</p><p>...</p><p>Very soon, Groups Three and One met up. The other three groups probably hadn't even passed the demon vine section, or they might have all been eliminated at the river valley.</p><p>That made sense, as not every wind mage dared to jump across the river valley.</p><p>"Let's go in together. Light mages, you're finally useful; light the torches!" Zhao Kun San became more daring with so many people around, though his sharp tongue hadn't changed.</p><p>The light mages complained one after another.</p><p>What could they do? Their basic skill was indeed nicknamed "Moving Flashlight."</p><p>The light mages used their abilities to illuminate the cave filled with rugged rocks, but deeper inside, it remained pitch black, making hearts race uncontrollably.</p><p>"Wind mages should lead; you have wind guidance skills, so if anything happens, you can retreat immediately." Mu Bai, as expected from a noble family, knew how to reasonably allocate roles within a team.</p><p>The wind mages didn't say much, and Zhao Kun San, Zhang Yinglu, Yang Xintian, and others had already taken the lead.</p><p>"Fan Ge, I'm going ahead to scout... what are you looking at?" Zhang Xiaohou was a wind mage and naturally responsible for scouting.</p><p>In the cave, such a large group of people wouldn't be able to proceed without someone leading them from the front. Once they encountered any situation, they would immediately fall into chaos. Mu Bai's decision was indeed correct.</p><p>Mo Fan still stood at the entrance of the cave, but his eyes were fixed on the pond in front of the cave opening.</p><p>It was normal for the pond to have water after it rained a few days ago.</p><p>However, Mo Fan noticed something unusual.</p><p>"There are still water marks around the edge of the pond, which indicates that the water in this pond originally should be at this position. The water marks can still be seen, and the time it took for the water level to drop would not exceed half a day... If it were evaporation, the speed would not be so fast..." Mo Fan muttered to himself.</p><p>"Could it be that someone brought water here?" Zhang Xiaohou said.</p><p>"We have already collected water by the lake, there is no reason to collect it again on the mountain," Mo Fan continued.</p><p>"What do you mean then..." Zhang Xiaohou rarely saw Mo Fan being so serious.</p><p>"The chief instructor mentioned that a pack of one-eyed werewolves once lived here. This pond at the entrance of the cave was most likely their drinking basin. The water level dropped several hours ago, and the water marks are still visible," Mo Fan reasoned.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou was not stupid; he quickly understood what Mo Fan meant, his face turning pale with fear.</p><p>"Fang Ge, don't scare me, you're saying there's something living inside this cave that came out to drink recently."</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou stammered.</p><p>"The water level dropped so much, indicating that the creature must be particularly large or not just one," Mo Fan added.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou's teeth were chattering.</p><p>"Let's go, maybe I'm being too cautious." Mo Fan clapped his hands and followed the team that had already entered the cave.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou hurriedly ran to the front of the line and told Mu Bai, Xu Shaoting, Zhou Min, and others about Mo Fan's discovery.</p><p>However, before Zhang Xiaohou could finish speaking, a foul-smelling demonic wind suddenly gushed out from within the cave, crazily hitting the faces of the 40 students...</p><p>That feeling was like a massive wave about to crash over them. Their hair and clothes were all in disarray, and they could even feel a spray of water mist splashing their faces!</p><p>"Ahhhh!!"</p><p>"Ahhhhhhhhh!!"</p><p>Suddenly, two terrifying cries echoed from the deeper part of the cave.</p><p>At this moment, everyone understood what that gust of wind filled with sticky moisture was!</p><p>Oh my God, it was saliva spurting out of the demon's mouth when it roared!!</p><p>All 40 students were frozen in place, their bodies stiff.</p><p>In the next second, their faces were about to contort, completely filled with fear from the depths of their hearts.</p><p>Demons!!!</p><p>It was demons!!!!</p><p>They had to deal with the topic of demons at school all the time and had rehearsed countless times in their minds how they would bravely fight against them. However, when they truly felt two green, greedy eyes staring from the depths of the cave, their minds went blank!</p><p>The light of the Light Mages still hovered in the air, illuminating the front part of the cavern.</p><p>A foot covered in green hair suddenly stepped out of the darkness, its sharp claws sinking into the ground...</p><p>Then, a head slowly emerged, exposed to the area illuminated by the light...</p><p>Rows of jagged fangs suddenly appeared, with terrifying canines hanging from the upper jaw down to the lower jaw, exposed to the air and to these students' eyes.</p><p>Green saliva dripped slowly from these two saber-like fangs, clearly indicating that this creature was hungry!</p><p>This demon stood before 40 students, green eyes surveying the delicious food laid out before it with greed and indifference!</p><p>"Run... Run... Run away!!!!"</p><p>The voice that trembled was unknown.</p>
