						<p>After walking through the ravine and navigating through the thickets of grass taller than people, they finally saw the Hundred Herbs Valley! The Hundred Herbs Valley likely had many entrances; to enter, one had to traverse the winding valleys ahead. "Why are there so many vines on this path? They seem to grow from the mountain all the way down to the ground, looking really disgusting," the more delicate girls immediately grumbled. Tree vines and grass vines crisscrossed in front of them, some resembling a python climbing the cliff face, others intricately entwined on the ground, giving the impression of entering a den of dark green pythons, which was terrifying to behold—no wonder some timid girls felt their hair stand on end when they saw it. "It's just some broken vines, what are you scared of? Come, follow me!" Wang Sanpang showcased his bravery in front of the female students and marched ahead resolutely. Wang Sanpang pushed aside a few thick vines hanging in front of him and walked forward with broad strides. His physique was indeed suited for clearing such paths; if he could pass through, the rest of the students would be able to do so as well. "Ah!!!! F*ck, what is this? Oh God, help me! Help!" Suddenly, Wang Sanpang let out a howl like an old dog being half beaten inside the thicket. All the students instinctively took a few steps back and looked closely, only to feel their scalp tingle. It turned out that those vines were actually moving!! The vines writhed and quickly bound Wang Sanpang up in knots as soon as he stepped into their territory, suspending his massive body upside down. There were thorns on the vines, and as they tightened, they tore through Wang Sanpang's fatty skin, causing him to bleed profusely, which made Zhang Yinglu and the other young girls scream uncontrollably. "What are you screaming for? Besides screaming, do you know how to do anything else!" Xu Zhaoqing immediately roared in frustration. As he spoke, Xu Zhaoqing stood still, and a star appeared before his forehead as a ghostly image, its dazzling purple hue mesmerizing to behold.</p><p>The stars appeared one by one, arranged neatly under Xu Zhao Ting's skilled control!</p><p>In an instant, a streak of star trails connected.</p><p>"Thunder Seal? Python Scar!"</p><p>Xu Zhao Ting executed his thunder skill seamlessly, and scorching arcs of lightning suddenly appeared around him.</p><p>These arcs of lightning, upon Xu Zhao Ting's command, shot towards the narrow passage and lashed out at the demon vines dragging Wang Sanpang.</p><p>"Sizzling~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>The Thunder Seal left many blackened marks on the demon vines. However, these plant-based demons were clearly not afraid of lightning attacks; they merely retreated slightly before boldly lifting Wang Sanpang upwards again!</p><p>"Help! H...help..." Wang Sanpang cried out in tears, but as a vine wrapped around his throat, he lost even the strength to shout.</p><p>The students became chaotic all at once.</p><p>Xu Zhao Ting's Thunder Seal had no effect whatsoever. How could they stop these demon vines?</p><p>"Ahhh!!!"</p><p>Another scream echoed; it turned out that these demon vines were not content with Wang Sanpang and had already set their sights on the delicate girls, one of whom was Zheng Yunxia whose ankle was trapped.</p><p>Zheng Yunxia was a water mage, but at this moment, she had probably forgotten what stardust even was, let alone casting any spells.</p><p>"Don't panic, I'll take care of them!!" Class president Zhou Minjiao shouted.</p><p>A streak of fire star trails rapidly formed around Zhou Minjiao. The already dignified Zhou Minjiao now exuded a fiery and tempestuous aura.</p><p>"Fire Sizzle? Burn!"</p><p>A flame erupted in Zhou Min's palm with a "boom," and as she waved her hand, the flame penetrated into the demon vines.</p><p>"Huhuhuhu~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>The burning fire immediately spread among the demon vines.</p><p>The tongues of fire danced wildly, spreading at an astonishing speed, engulfing a large area of demon vines in mere moments.</p><p>These demon vines were extremely afraid of fire. After Zhou Min's Fire Surge landed, the vines scattered as quickly as if they had seen a ghost.</p><p>The vines soon released Wang Sanpang, who was hanging from them and fell down. Luckily, he landed on his round belly; otherwise, his face would have certainly been smashed in.</p><p>"Captain is awesome!!"</p><p>"It really works better with fire magic; these demon vines were so scared that they wet their pants."</p><p>"Yeah, Captain is amazing!"</p><p>A group of classmates, seeing the demon vines retreat significantly, all cheered loudly.</p><p>Xu Shaoting, the proud Lightning Mage, stood there with an unsightly expression.</p><p>Plant life naturally has resistance to lightning magic, and there was nothing that could be done about it.</p><p>Mo Fan watched from the side but did not use any fire spells at all throughout.</p><p>After all, Captain Zhou Min could already handle these demon vines; there was no need for him to intervene.</p><p>Moreover...</p><p>Zhou Min's Fire Surge was still at Level 1, whereas his own Fire Surge had activated on the day of their expedition... Hehehe!</p><p>Tiny demon vines, without Uncle needing to step in, we should save as much blue mana as possible!</p><p>…</p><p>"Zhou Min, the fire spellcaster. Hmm, hmm, this girl is quite to my liking." Inside a certain tent, Chief Instructor Shanzhong stroked his stubble and said.</p><p>"Shouldn’t Group One be the fastest now? There are several outstanding students in Group One," Zhang Jianguo asked.</p><p>"The fire spellcaster in Group One is a dud; he couldn’t release any spells when faced with demon vines. In the end, it was that student named Mu Bai who froze and slowed down the demon vines, making him the fastest and most successful in reaching Hundred Herbs Valley. They will soon encounter the Shadow Wolves! It’s time for their true test!"</p><p>"Will the Shadow Wolves hurt the students?"</p><p>"They’ll definitely get injured; breaking a few bones is normal. However, our summoner and his Shadow Wolf have control," Pan Lijun said.</p><p>"Why not give them a call to remind them? If they get seriously injured, it will affect their university entrance exams next year."</p><p>"There’s no signal in the valley. Don’t worry; Bai Yang knows what he’s doing." Luo Yunbo said.</p><p>"Bai Yang? Isn’t that the Light Mage who was reported as KIA?"</p><p>Tang Yue was stunned for a moment.</p><p>Shanzhong smiled. "It’s fabricated. He is our Snowpeak Mountain Station’s summoner, guarding the old lair of the one-eyed demon wolf. However, he does have a blue bracelet inside the lair."</p><p>Tang Yue was speechless; this chief instructor is full of schemes!</p><p>I wonder if these students can make it through safely.</p>
