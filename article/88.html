						<p>The Sacred Spring was located right beneath the Silver Trade Tower, which came as a surprise to Mo Fan. This was because the rooftop where he had met Mu Ningxue the other day was just one building away from the Silver Trade Tower.</p><p>This Silver Trade Tower stood tall and straight in a pentagonal shape. It would be more accurate to say that it resembled a towering pentagonal pagoda standing at the very heart of Bo City.</p><p>The tower reached 200 meters in height, its entire exterior enveloped by tempered glass, shimmering like a sword drawn from its scabbard under the sun’s rays. At night, the entire building was aglow with lights, its neon glow visible even from distant parts of the city.</p><p>The Sacred Spring, a treasure spot in Bo City, was actually located beneath this Silver Trade Tower. Many white-collar and high-income workers in the building were unaware that there were fifteen underground floors!</p><p>Mo Fan was transported down to the fifteenth floor of the Silver Trade Tower via an elevator resembling a secret agent base, only to find what seemed like a secret chamber hidden away, unknown to the public.</p><p>The chamber was constructed from extremely special crystal stone artifacts, clearly the work of a highly skilled architect.</p><p>A patrol team of around one platoon guarded the chamber, with its captain being a mid-rank mage.</p><p>A mid-rank mage guarding the entrance?</p><p>This alone proved just how valuable the Sacred Spring was to Bo City.</p><p>"Behind this totem gate is the Sacred Spring. You can enter for a week’s training. The Sacred Spring maintains a natural cycle; don’t touch it. Just sit on the meditation cushion in its center and meditate or control it," Mu Zhuoyun said irritably to Mo Fan.</p><p>The Sacred Spring was originally meant for Yu Ang, but it had ended up in the hands of this brat, Mo Fan. It’s no wonder Mu Zhuoyun was in a bad mood.</p><p>Tang Yue accompanied Mo Fan. She nodded slightly at him, indicating that he could proceed inside to meditate.</p><p>"Oh, I have something for you," Tang Yue recalled something and said to Mo Fan.</p><p>"For me?" Mo Fan was surprised.</p><p>Tang Yue suddenly produced four scrolls with purple and red hues inscribed on them. These scrolls bore star-like dots and patterns resembling star tracks, resembling a complete magical diagram of some sort.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, your generosity truly knows no bounds. This is a precious Star Map Book, and you're not just giving me one but four copies. This has certainly opened my eyes as a commoner," Mu Zhuoyun immediately recognized the scroll Teacher Tang Yue had given and said with a sour expression.</p><p>"What is this Star Map Book?" Mo Fan asked in confusion.</p><p>"After undergoing the baptism of the Sacred Spring, you should be close to becoming an Intermediate Mage. I'm not sure if I'll continue teaching here; before I leave, I'll give you these Star Map Books so that you can have some self-defense capabilities after reaching Intermediate Mage level," Teacher Tang Yue paused briefly and then explained the purpose of the Star Map Book: "You should know that basic magic requires connecting star seeds into a star path. Only when the star path appears does magic manifest."</p><p>Mo Fan nodded, as if listening to his teacher's lesson on an even higher tier of magic.</p><p>"When you become an Intermediate Mage, your stardust will transform into a star cloud. A star cloud is more extensive than stardust and contains 49 star seeds. The formation of intermediate magic involves connecting these 49 star seeds into a star map. Only when the star map appears can intermediate magic be born..."</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue explained.</p><p>Stardust becomes a star cloud.</p><p>Connecting 49 star seeds to form a star map is what creates intermediate magic!</p><p>Mo Fan silently memorized these crucial words in his heart.</p><p>"You should understand that mastering seven star seeds requires an incredibly long period of cultivation. The difficulty of managing 49 star seeds is more than double or triple, and even after your stardust turns into a star cloud, you still need considerable time to release intermediate magic. What's special about the Star Map Book is that once you inject your intent into it, the book will emit a unique attraction causing your 49 star seeds to arrange themselves according to the engraved star map. Even if you don't yet have sufficient control over the 49 star seeds, as long as there's enough magic energy in your star cloud, you can still release intermediate magic," Teacher Tang Yue earnestly advised.</p><p>Mo Fan opened his mouth, never having imagined that such a miraculous thing existed in this world.</p><p>If there are Star Map Books like these, what's the point of mages working so hard to control their magic? They could just carry around several dozen scrolls!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun clearly saw Mo Fan's inner confusion and scoffed, "You can't buy a Star Map Book even if you had all the money in the world. Your Teacher Tang Yue isn't simply a public school teacher."</p><p>Mo Fan looked at this mature and beautiful teacher before him and was even more surprised.</p><p>Thinking carefully, a teacher who could easily resolve stardust magic artifacts wasn't just an ordinary high school teacher. Furthermore, Mo Fan had witnessed Teacher Tang Yue using shadow magic skills; she must be at least an Intermediate Mage!</p><p>"You are naturally dual-elemental, so it's inevitable that some people will envy you. These scrolls are for your protection. Of course, to use these Star Map Books, your stardust must first turn into a star cloud, and your seven star seeds must become 49. Otherwise, the Star Map Book will drain your body and turn you into a mummy," Teacher Tang Yue warned sternly once more.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded seriously, feeling a bit touched in his heart.</p><p>I am merely an ordinary teacher-student relationship with Teacher Tang Yue, yet she shows me such care. It seems I must urgently cultivate to reach the intermediate level and earn more money so that I can marry her and repay her kindness for a lifetime.</p><p>"Thank you, Teacher Tang Yue! I will work twice as hard!" Mo Fan said sincerely.</p><p>Tang Yue smiled faintly, those bright eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>"Don't get too conceited, this Earth Holy Spring is indeed a celestial spring, but it's impossible to let you reach the intermediate level. It merely serves as the greatest aid in pushing you towards the intermediate stage; if you want to truly break through to the intermediate level... hehe, that's still far off!" Mu Zhuoyun sneered.</p><p>Tang Yue did not say anything else, having conveyed what she needed to. She turned and left.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun was too lazy to waste his time on this guy who seemed to be completely unlikable and waved his hand to signal the Earth Holy Spring guardian that they could drag Mo Fan in for detention.</p><p>"Stay alert! Last time, some gutter rats nearly found their way here. If the Earth Holy Spring's essence spreads, attracting calamity, you will all answer for it!" said Captain Liang Bin, the guard commander.</p><p>"Captain, rest assured, this will never happen again!" the other guards solemnly vowed.</p><p>The last thing Mo Fan heard as he entered the Earth Holy Spring was the words of the guards. This reminded him of that one-eyed werewolf that had nearly advanced in level.</p>
