						<p>"I wonder what Young Miss Mu Ningxue's expression will be when she sees you being expelled from the Magic High School in front of the entire faculty and students. I bet she'll regret ever wanting to escape with such a waste," Mu Bai no longer needed to hide his intentions, and he whispered sinisterly into Mo Fan's ear.</p><p>"You have bad breath; I can't stand the smell of feces. Don't get too close to me." Mo Fan waved his hand to block himself.</p><p>Mu Bai twitched at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Let this brat show off a bit first!</p><p>Back then, he had beaten Mu Bai senseless in front of Mu Ningxue, pressing him into the mud and grass, leaving him unable to raise his head in front of her ever again. The shame still lingered.</p><p>Today, Mu Bai was going to make this guy suffer even more.</p><p>Being expelled publicly before the entire school, especially in front of Mu Ningxue, would be a humiliation for Mo Fan in this society that revered magic. How would he face his father, Mo Jia Xing, who had sold his house to send him to Magic High School? How would he explain himself?</p><p>However, if a student's magical stardust showed almost no growth, the school would directly announce their expulsion!</p><p>Normally, after a student awakened stardust, it would gradually glow and increase mana even for the most foolish person, unless they were extremely lazy!</p><p>To punish students who wasted their awakening resources and magic books, and to make all students understand that cultivation was not a joke or a way to waste time, the school would publicly announce the expulsion of underperforming students.</p><p>Such public announcements might happen once per year, established specifically to motivate underachievers.</p><p>At the beginning of this semester, they had conducted a rough assessment. Back then, Mo Fan's cultivation level was almost zero, and Xue Mushiang had almost decided to reserve that spot for him.</p><p>This semester ended, and it was time for the most solemn annual evaluation.</p><p>Of course, to prevent any accidents, Mu Bai and his uncle, Mu He, had also prepared a generous gift for Mo Fan.</p><p>This gift was sufficient to ensure that Mo Fan would pass stably and receive a punishment that the school had not administered in three years.</p><p>Fortunately, Mu Ningxue and Mu Zhuoyun were present and witnessed this scene with their own eyes.</p><p>Thinking of these things, Mu Bai's mood suddenly improved greatly.</p><p>Today was the day to showcase himself and soar to new heights, as well as the day when Mo Fan, the wretch, would suffer humiliation. What a pleasant thought!</p><p>……</p><p>The annual evaluation formally began!</p><p>All thirty classes conducted the tests simultaneously.</p><p>The testing process was actually very simple: under everyone's watchful eyes and the examiner's scrutiny, one had to place their hand on the Star Sensory Stone, concentrate, and enter into meditation. At this moment, the Star Sensory Stone would reflect light corresponding to the strength of the test taker's stardust glow. The intensity of the light determined the level of cultivation.</p><p>Each student had three opportunities.</p><p>The score was based on the brightest light emitted.</p><p>Of course, students who were more focused could have their Star Sensory Stones accurately display their stardust strength.</p><p>The testing order was random, and the first to test was that delicate-looking He Yu, whose appearance resembled a flower petal soaked in rain.</p><p>She still seemed very timid and walked hesitantly towards the Star Sensory Stone under everyone's gaze, as if she was deeply afraid of being expelled.</p><p>"Begin," said the bald examiner.</p><p>He Yu, student, cheer up. The teacher and your classmates all believe in you," said Principal Xue Musheng.</p><p>"Even if you don't do well, it's fine. I'll take care of you," said Jianhua Headmaster, who was a bit absent-minded.</p><p>He Yu timidly closed her eyes and placed her small hand on the enormous Sensory Stone.</p><p>The entire class fell silent instantly, all eyes fixed on this girl, the first to undergo the test, looking even more nervous than she was.</p><p>For some reason, Mo Fan felt that He Yu's demeanor changed after entering the testing area. Her expression became serious and focused; though tense, there was no hint of panic.</p><p>A faint glow began to emanate from within the black Sensory Stone, initially resembling a streak of dawn at the horizon. As He Yu concentrated with furrowed brows, this light gradually spread around the stone, almost filling it!</p><p>"a!"</p><p>"a!"</p><p>"a!"</p><p>In that moment, all three examiners announced their results simultaneously.</p><p>"Student, you may stop now. Your final grade is an A!" said the bald main examiner expressionlessly.</p><p>He Yu opened her eyes, her face brimming with incredulous joy. "R-really? I got an A? I got an A?"</p><p>Though it was strange to see a girl so excitedly shouting that she got an A, it had to be acknowledged that He Yu's exam result amazed everyone present.</p><p>"I-I can't believe it! An A, this is the standard for getting into the top class!"</p><p>"Unbelievable. She was crying and wailing before the test; we all thought she was on the verge of being expelled. But in the end, she got an A!!"</p><p>"Magic slut, typical magic student, I don't believe her anymore."</p><p>When the result came out, Mo Fan’s class monitor Jianhua was stunned.</p><p>Why bother raising a chicken? He could only be satisfied with getting a B on his own. Worrying about who would get an A was pointless.</p><p>Class teacher Xue Mussheng’s expression froze as he had been tricked by a female student’s innocent act, but since the first assessment resulted in an A for their class, Xue Mussheng was still pleased overall.</p><p>All scores would be integrated and synthesized, then compared across 30 classes. Xue Mussheng felt his class had a good chance of placing in the top three.</p><p>Their biggest competitor was Class 7 next door, with Xu Zhao ting, that lightning-fast kid. It was uncertain whether they could outperform them, but he hoped their most outstanding student, Mu Bai, would not fall short!</p><p>"The next item, any assessment required?" The bald examiner asked He Yu.</p><p>He Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, "I only have six stars, so I’ll skip it."</p><p>"Alright, we will decide your class based on the evaluations from your other teachers," the bald examiner replied.</p><p>"Thank you, teacher."</p><p>He Yu walked out happily, intending to share the news with her friends. However, she found them each maintaining a distance of one meter, which puzzled her.</p><p>Hadn’t she done anything wrong? Her grades were so good?</p><p>"The next candidate is Zhang Xiaohou," the examiner called out.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou was stunned; he hadn’t expected it to be his turn so soon.</p><p>"Brother Fan, I’m going," Zhang Xiaohou told Mo Fan.</p><p>"Yeah, do your best and stay calm," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Just stop giving advice to others; it’s making me want to vomit," Zhao Kun three predictably chimed in.</p><p>Mo Fan was puzzled. Was Zhao Kun San in automatic follow mode and full-screen chat mode, how could this guy pour cold water on him no matter where he went?</p>
