						<p>Mo Fan was just about to leave when he suddenly felt a shadow moving beside him.</p><p>The shadow circled around the black stone wall and descended, appearing in front of Mo Fan. Soon after, Mo Fan saw a woman with an hourglass figure slowly rising from the shadow. The surprising scene left Mo Fan momentarily stunned.</p><p>F*ck, what kind of skill is this, totally awesome!!</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue..." Mo Fan recognized the woman's face; it was a very standard almond-shaped face with willow-leaf eyebrows and fox-like eyes!</p><p>"Are you alright??" Teacher Tang Yue’s face lit up with a delighted smile.</p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue's gaze shifted, quickly noticing the ghoul wolf beast pinned there like a specimen, leaving her momentarily speechless.</p><p>"This... This..." Teacher Tang Yue exclaimed in shock.</p><p>"You've raised a very monstrous student. The ghoul wolf beast was killed by him," said Chief Instructor Zhankong.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue gaped open her mouth in surprise and stared at Mo Fan intently.</p><p>Feeling awkward under her gaze, Mo Fan coughed and said, "Save people first, save people first..."</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the cave entrance, Mu Bai, Xu Zhao ting, Zhao Kunsi, Zhang Shuhua, He Yu, and others regained consciousness.</p><p>The other students gradually came to their senses as well, huddling around the fountain like refugees, still trembling.</p><p>Before long, Chief Instructor and Teacher Tang Yue led Mo Fan out of the cave.</p><p>When everyone saw that Mo Fan was actually alive, each person's face revealed an expression akin to seeing a ghost!</p><p>To know that they had witnessed with their own eyes Mo Fan and Zhang Xiao Hou being chased into the cave, under such circumstances, even a hundred lives would be torn to shreds by that ghost wolf beast.</p><p>"Mo Fan… Mo Fan… you guys are not dead??" He Yu finally came to her senses, seeing that both Zhang Xiao Hou and Mo Fan were still alive, tears streamed down her face.</p><p>Zhou Min, the class president, saw that they were unharmed and her eyes turned red as well.</p><p>If it weren’t for Mo Fan and Zhang Xiao Hou leading the ghost wolf beast into the cave, who knew how many people would have lost their lives. Regardless of what happened, they had saved everyone!</p><p>The other girls, who were also injured, started sobbing. Having studied magic in school comfortably, none of them had experienced such a situation.</p><p>The boys either sat on the ground in a daze or cheered for Mo Fan and Zhang Xiao Hou, the heroes.</p><p>They originally thought that having magic would allow them to command the winds and summon rain; they were all arrogant at school. In the end, when facing demons, they couldn’t even use their skills. If not for Mo Fan and Zhang Xiao Hou diverting the ghost wolf beast, the outcome would have been unimaginable.</p><p>"By the way, how did you two escape the wolf’s clutches? And what about that one-eyed demon wolf?" Wang Sanpang and Xu Zhao Ting asked.</p><p>"That goes without saying; the one-eyed demon wolf was definitely killed by Instructor Shanjing. Instructor Shanjing came just in time; if he had been a little slower, they might have been eaten," Zhao Kunsan said.</p><p>Instructor Shanjing glanced at Zhao Kunsan, who was being sarcastic, and couldn’t help but laugh. Despite being students, the differences between them were quite significant.</p><p>"Since everyone is out of danger, I can say some things now." Instructor Shanjing said.</p><p>They were all sitting by the mountain mouth now; the teacher was bandaging their wounds, while some students were cleaning each other’s bloodstains.</p><p>"In the process of completing this bounty mission, we have actually been following you and scoring students who performed well, such as Zhang Xiao Hou, Zhou Min, Mu Bai, Li Yue Ming, and others…" Instructor Shanjing said.</p><p>These words instantly stirred up a commotion among the students.</p><p>It turned out that they had already been under the coach’s observation during this training process. Many of them started regretting why they hadn’t performed better.</p><p>"When that demon appeared… why didn’t you guys… did you have to wait until we were all dead before stepping in?!" Mu Bai said, somewhat angrily.</p><p>Honestly, he almost got killed by the demon.</p><p>"If that Wraithwolf really wanted to kill you all, you would have already died in heaps, especially you!" the Chief Instructor Zhan Kong said with a cold snort.</p><p>Mu Bai frowned and recalled what had happened earlier. Indeed, if the Wraithwolf had directly slammed its front legs onto him, he would be dead.</p><p>"Hold on, Chief Instructor, what did you mean by demon? Was it really a Wraithwolf??" Zhou Min suddenly realized something and asked hurriedly.</p><p>"That's right, it wasn't a one-eyed demonic wolf but a Wraithwolf. It was a summon beast," Zhan Kong continued.</p><p>"I'll explain this to everyone. This reward mission was arranged between us teachers and instructors, including the summon beast, which is actually Instructor Bai Yang's summon beast. We needed you all to truly face a demon, but we didn't want any of you to get killed by it..." Teacher Xue Musheng explained.</p><p>At these words, all the students cried!</p><p>It turned out to be just a drill, but did they really have to make it so realistic? They genuinely thought they were going to die this time.</p><p>Moreover, the Wraithwolf's combat power was too terrifying. Even with everyone casting spells on it, it didn't work.</p><p>"I was wondering how Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou managed to survive, turns out it was because of a summon beast..." Zhao Kun San said disdainfully.</p><p>"That's where you're wrong. In fact, something unexpected happened that exceeded our expectations. The Wraithwolf suddenly went berserk and became uncontrollable. It no longer obeyed Instructor Bai Yang's commands. Just when we thought the Wraithwolf would start slaughtering you all, Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou led it into a cave, so your lives were saved by the two of them," Zhang Jianguo said.</p><p>"Good heavens, then we were really lucky."</p><p>Zhang Yinglu couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p>"What luck? It was Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou who saved us. Big brothers, you can order us to do anything from now on, we'll go through fire and water for you!!"</p><p>"We're so grateful that you stepped in for us; you two will be our leaders from now on!"</p><p>Wang Sanpang and Xu Shaoting, this pair of close friends, although proud and arrogant, couldn't help but express their gratitude to Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou at this moment.</p><p>Mu Bai and Zhao Kun San stood there with their faces turning pale. How could they have known that the person they hated most had actually saved their lives?</p><p>"Teacher, please take good care of this cave. If that frenzied summoning beast charges out again..." Zhou Min reminded.</p><p>"Don't worry, the summoning beast is already dead," Teacher Tang Yue said.</p><p>"Hmm, Mo Fan killed it," Zhan Kong nodded.</p><p>"Oh, glad to hear that, glad to hear that. Such a frenzied summoning beast... Wait a minute, Chief Instructor, what did you just say??" Wang Sanpang was momentarily taken aback and asked with wide eyes.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>(speaking of something!!!</p><p>On the evening of June 10th from 7:30 to 8:30, we will be hosting a Q&A session on Sān Jiāng. Feel free to ask me any questions about your personal life, difficulties in climbing ranks, or anything unrelated to the novel~~~ Back to the topic, Uncle Luanshan will meet everyone and not miss this opportunity.</p><p>Also, to that student who waited for my update on the night before the college entrance exam, I had already advised you to stay calm. What good does it do now to complain about me? I've said it before; if you didn't pass the exam this year, you can always try again next year. Missing out on reading the full-time mage updates in time is a lifelong regret. Now, should I be blamed for that?)</p>
