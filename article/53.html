						<p>"That's still not happening. I want to get into a good magic university; I heard that more advanced magic can only be learned there," Mo Fan said.</p><p>The chief instructor was quite angry upon hearing this.</p><p>What a brat! It's your fortune to join my unit, and you're actually refusing it!</p><p>"Oh right, is there only one worgen beast guarding that cave?" Mo Fan remembered something as he was about to leave and asked.</p><p>"Just one. If there were any others, you would all have been food by now. What, do you have any questions?"</p><p>"Nothing much, just curious," Mo Fan nodded and glanced at Captain Bai Yang. "Your worgen beast sure can drink."</p><p>Bai Yang looked puzzled but didn't pay it too much mind.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan was kicked out of the camp by a roaring command, mumbling to himself: Is it really that big a deal for a high-ranking mage to send some magic gear? </p><p>The scythe shield was now in Mo Fan's palm... </p><p>The entire scythe shield barely covered his palm. Mo Fan, who knew nothing about magic gear, was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Such a tiny thing can actually block demon attacks? Does he really think all demons have OCD and must hit the American captain's shield?</p><p>After some research, Mo Fan finally figured out how to use the scythe shield.</p><p>When a mage probes into the scythe shield with their mind, it automatically connects to the mage's soul, leaving an imprint of the magic gear in the mage's spiritual world.</p><p>When the mage activated this imprint with their mind, the magical item would instantly appear before the user. At that moment, the shield would no longer be palm-sized but would transform into a towering wall of shields reaching over a person’s height, making it impossible for the Sandstorm skill of the Shadowwolf Beast to harm them at all!</p><p>"It's no wonder this thing is so valuable. If I had the Scythe Shield magical item when dealing with the Shadowwolf Beast, I could have safely cast my spells," Mo Fan said as he looked at the giant bone shield before him, which was shaped like a diamond and bore the pattern of a scythe. A smile couldn't help but appear on his face.</p><p>With this magical item, he felt more confident in facing Mu Shi's Yu Ang!</p><p>"Speaking of which, I have lightning and fire spells, Scythe Mark and Fire Infusion, which are quite useful, but they're not enough when it comes to a direct battle with demons," Mo Fan couldn't help but think about the issue.</p><p>Killing the Shadowwolf Beast this time was largely due to luck. If not for the light in the cave revealing the stalactites deep within, if not for Zhang Xiaohou's Wind Track, and if not for his previous students' coordinated assault, he would have been instantly shredded by the Shadowwolf Beast. There was no way he could have completed this quest so smoothly.</p><p>"I need to learn skills similar to Wind Track and Earth Wave that allow rapid movement and quick position changes, otherwise, with my slow speed, I might be smacked down by a demon before I even complete Star Track!"</p><p>After this battle, Mo Fan realized how important defensive and mobility skills were.</p><p>At the beginner level, only the water elemental system had defensive capabilities. Water Defense was the only defensive skill in the initial stage of elemental magic, and everyone at school considered it useless. In reality, water mages became their saviors during battles with demons.</p><p>"I have a Scythe Shield, which is somewhat equivalent to having a defensive skill. So, if I awaken next time, I might consider an element like wind… or something as cool as Teacher Tang Yue's skill of moving in shadows."</p><p>The beginner-level Wind Track was indeed very effective. Without being able to escape from demon pursuit, one wouldn't even have the chance to cast spells.</p><p>Wind was a good choice, but Mo Fan felt that the dark elemental system would suit him better!</p><p>After some research, he learned that the shadow-moving skill Teacher Tang Yue used belonged to the Shadowdark magic system!</p><p>At this stage, everyone only encountered elemental magic.</p><p>In fact, apart from "elemental magic," there were three other major categories of magic: White Magic, Black Magic, and Dimensional Magic!</p><p>Among them, healing spells belonged to one of the subcategories of White Magic.</p><p>The Shadow Magic school is one of the branches of Dark Magic.</p><p>While Bai Yang controls the Summoning Magic school, which is a branch of Dimensional Magic.</p><p>In the nine-year compulsory magic education and high school curriculum, only elemental magic is taught. Knowledge of the three major categories—Dark Magic, White Magic, and Dimensional Magic—is not covered until university.</p><p>Now, Mo Fan possesses Fire Magic, a high-damage skill, and Lightning Magic, which combines overwhelming control with immense power. The appearance of Scythe Shield has given him some defensive capabilities, but he lacks mobility skills.</p><p>To truly battle a demon alone, one must possess all these abilities to stand a chance!</p><p>Shadow Magic!</p><p>Clearly, this would be a very suitable choice for me.</p><p>"I need to quickly advance to the intermediate level so that I can awaken another school. Fingers crossed it will be Shadow Magic!" Mo Fan said with great anticipation.</p><p>At the beginner level, everyone awakens only one school of magic.</p><p>Mo Fan is naturally gifted in two schools, which already puts him at a significant advantage.</p><p>By the time they reach the intermediate level, mages not only learn intermediate-level magic skills but also gain the opportunity to awaken for the second time, birthing a new star dust!</p><p>Only after awakening another school will mages experience a substantial increase in combat power!</p><p>Like Chief Instructor Shanka, when Mo Fan first met him, he was playing with flames, indicating that he is a Fire Magic mage.</p><p>However, during their encounter in the cave, a breathtaking wind wing appeared behind him.</p><p>Clearly, in addition to Fire Magic, he has also mastered Wind Magic.</p><p>Furthermore, it can be inferred that Chief Instructor Shanka likely possesses another school of magic as well.</p><p>The Wind Wings is a skill that only high-level mages can master. Mid-level mages already possess dual-element abilities, and upon reaching the high-level mage stage, they gain an opportunity for a third awakening, resulting in control over three elements!! </p><p>Mid-level mages undergo another awakening to control dual-element magic.</p><p>High-level mages undergo yet another awakening to control tri-element magic.</p><p>Mo Fan was naturally gifted with dual-element abilities, giving him a step up from others right from the start.</p><p>Without the combination of lightning and fire skills, Mo Fan would never have been able to kill that shadow wolf beast. Chief Instructor Zhan Kong could never understand why the shadow wolf beast kept dodging the falling stalactites; this was because he never imagined that in addition to being a fire mage, Mo Fan also possessed star dust from the lightning element, and it was the paralysis effect of the Lightning Seal that prevented the shadow wolf beast from moving!</p><p>“I have Slime Pendant, and my cultivation time is twice as long as others’, so I advance much faster than them. However, just having the Lightning Seal and Fire Surge skills is not enough to stand alone; I need to quickly reach mid-level mage status. This way, not only can I possess the mid-level abilities of fire and lightning, but I can also gain a skill from another element. More skills mean more options!”</p><p>Mm, mm, good job!</p><p>What was that slogan of all the boys in Class Eight??</p><p>Right, make money, cultivate, marry Tang Yue!</p>
