						<p>"Already, a squad has found an entrance to the demon realm and successfully destroyed it." Colonel Cheng walked back from the side, saying in a dark and heavy tone, "That should be something to be happy about."</p><p>"That's great to hear," Xu Dahang immediately smiled.</p><p>"The entire squad was wiped out; no one survived," Colonel Cheng added softly.</p><p>Xu Dahang's smile froze immediately.</p><p>Others also opened their mouths but couldn't muster any joy anymore.</p><p>In fact, when selecting the team members, Colonel Cheng had already clearly told them that they were likely to have no return trip on this mission.</p><p>"Let's keep moving forward; we should be close to Mingwen Girls' High School," Colonel Cheng said.</p><p>"Yes, after passing through these old houses, there will be a student street. Beyond the student street, you'll see the entrance of the girls' high school. Reports indicated that vibrations lasted for a long time in the school's cafeteria, so it's likely that the demon entrance is beneath their cafeteria," Xu Dahang explained.</p><p>Everyone nodded and continued to follow Xu Dahang's directions.</p><p>On the way, they encountered some troublesome demons, but Colonel Cheng quickly dealt with them.</p><p>Mid-level mages had lethal damage against servant-class demons, often achieving instant kills. Therefore, their progress was very swift.</p><p>"Help! Help~~~~~~~~~~~ Save me~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Just as they were about to continue, a piercing cry suddenly echoed from the street ahead.</p><p>Xu Dahang was just about to take action when Colonel Cheng immediately stepped in front of him.</p><p>Xu Dahan's face was full of confusion. Just as he was about to speak, Captain Cheng said coldly, "I told you when we set out that our mission is to destroy the demon entrance. We will not intervene to save anyone along the way, even if they are family members. The only people here besides Mo Fan are those who came to rescue him. I hope everyone understands what their duty is!"</p><p>There was another moment of silence among them.</p><p>They were all military mages and obedience was their duty, so no matter how desperate the cries coming from the corner ahead sounded, they could only grit their teeth and remain in place.</p><p>Mo Fan was still somewhat shocked.</p><p>But upon closer thought, he understood the rationale behind this seemingly heartless decision.</p><p>If they saved even one person along the way, the team would turn into a rescue squad. Carrying so many burdens, they would never be able to enter the demon entrance.</p><p>The longer the demon entrance remained open, the more people would die. They had no choice but to make this selection, and even if they could easily save the people on the street with just an outstretched hand, they could not do so.</p><p>After about two minutes, the cries finally ceased.</p><p>A short while later, Instructor Luo Yunbo returned to the team and addressed Captain Cheng, "The demons have left. We can proceed."</p><p>Luo Yunbo had personally witnessed those people being killed, and his expression was far from pleasant. Clearly, if he were not on a mission, he would have saved them.</p><p>…</p><p>Up ahead lay a relatively spacious street that was deserted with no vehicles in sight. However, several bloody corpses scattered across the asphalt road were truly horrifying, especially since these people had only died recently.</p><p>Taking a few steps forward, they saw a rotting obese man lying there.</p><p>This man seemed not to be fully dead yet; he was staring at the team with wide-open eyes, making great efforts to lift his head and look at them.</p><p>His eyes were filled with anger and confusion.</p><p>While crawling here covered in blood, he had clearly seen a group of mages through the reflection in a building's glass window.</p><p>He just shouted, shouting that these mages could save him.</p><p>However, when the demons bit off both of his legs and his lower body was about to be completely devoured, those heartless mages remained unmoved...</p><p>As these military mages walked past him, he mustered all his remaining strength to grab one of their pant legs. He wanted to ask, to fiercely question these despicable military mages why they stood by and did nothing!!</p><p>Pan Lijun paused slightly, glancing at the obese man who was barely breathing, with eyes that rolled without any emotion.</p><p>In the next second, she took a step forward and continued walking.</p><p>No one lingered to look at that miserable man; they kept moving quickly.</p><p>A few steps later, they saw several disfigured corpses...</p><p>When they reached the center of the road, the military mages, burdened by inner guilt, noticed a female corpse near an underground well. Her neck had been torn open by a giant-eyed rat.</p><p>"They probably tried to escape through the sewers, but..." Luo Yunbo said in a low voice.</p><p>"The sewers are the lair of the giant-eyed rats; they're courting death," Xu Dahuang shook his head helplessly.</p><p>The sewer was the last place they should have gone to—the demons had used the underground world of Boheng City to infiltrate various areas.</p><p>"Let's go. We won't destroy the demon entrance, more people will die," Colonel Cheng said without any emotion.</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Mo Fan just started to walk forward when he suddenly stopped.</p><p>His gaze was fixed on the woman's wrist lying beside the well... He had never seen this woman before, yet her bracelet was strangely familiar.</p><p>This was a DIY bracelet Mo Fan bought for Ye Xinxia on her sixteenth birthday when they went shopping in the student street. The bracelet consisted of differently shaped beads strung together, with one particularly ugly black bead being the only one he managed to thread successfully.</p><p>Other boys and girls were stringing beads with one person handling half, but Mo Fan, the forgetful man, spent a long time fitting the misplaced black bead onto the chain, resulting in the pretty DIY bracelet being tainted as if by a clump of rat droppings. Xin Xia was, however, very happy to wear it every day.</p><p>Although such bracelets were common everywhere, the unique black design on this one was easily identifiable. This must have been the DIY bracelet that Mo Fan and Xin Xia had "collaboratively" made together, but why would it be on a stranger's wrist?</p><p>"Mo Fan, what's wrong?" Pan Li Jun turned around from walking ahead, puzzled.</p><p>"I think I found a clue; this woman is wearing my sister's bracelet," Mo Fan took the bracelet off the woman and after examining it closely, he was even more certain.</p><p>"That dead fat man behind us had Walmart's logo on his back. These people should have escaped from the Walmart underground tunnel to here; they were discovered by the giant-eyed monkeys mid-route and ended up escaping onto land," Pan Li Jun said.</p><p>Mo Fan looked down into the well and indeed saw two more corpses, and the smell emanating from them confirmed that they had climbed out from below...</p><p>"There should only be one Walmart on the first floor underground of Wenming Shopping Mall in this area," Xu Da Huang was very familiar with the neighborhood and immediately told Mo Fan.</p><p>The previous search felt like searching for a needle in a haystack to Mo Fan, but it seemed that fate favored him by leading him to a clue.</p><p>Although he couldn't be certain that Xin Xia was inside the supermarket, at least he had a direction to follow instead of aimlessly searching around like a headless fly.</p><p>"Mo Fan, although you have performed a great deed in protecting the holy spring, this doesn't mean our team will delay the mission to save your sister. From now on, it's up to yourself," Captain Cheng said sternly.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded and replied, "I understand."</p><p>"Good luck then." Captain Cheng didn't say anything more, leading the team to continue forward.</p><p>"Good luck to you all as well."</p>
