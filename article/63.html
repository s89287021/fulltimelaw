						<p>During the remaining days of summer vacation, Mo Fan continued to maintain his cultivation. The job of a city monster-hunting team was not very demanding; it was more about adjusting one's own life rhythm. After following the monster-hunting team to complete two monster-hunting missions, Mo Fan should be considered to have completely left behind the realm of novices and could remain calm while releasing skills when facing demons.</p><p>Combining combat with cultivation, Mo Fan found that the growth rate of his stardust was accelerating. As his stardust grew, naturally, his starlets also underwent transformation. On the first day of senior three, Mo Fan successfully let his lightning-type starlet undergo a complete transformation. The brighter and more dazzling starlet could conduct stronger thunder magic energy, and the skills it performed would naturally change.</p><p>It is said that when starlets transform into level 3, they get closer to becoming an intermediate-level mage. Mo Fan didn't know when he would reach the level of an intermediate mage, but he was determined to use every means possible to make himself stronger!!</p><p>School life remained the same. After going through trials and tribulations, the students' demeanor had noticeably changed. With the magic college entrance exam approaching, even those usually carefree students were putting in extra effort and frequently appearing at training grounds. Mo Fan didn't go to the training ground anymore. Beating up a dummy puppet was of no use; he now directly turned this meaningless training into actual combat, facing demons head-on, which had much better results than hitting puppets on the school field!</p><p>"Fangge, have you noticed? Since undergoing trials, our usually arrogant class monitor Zhou Min has been particularly good to you," Zhang Xiaohou whispered in Mo Fan's ear.</p><p>"Is there?" Mo Fan asked with raised eyebrows.</p><p>"There certainly is. Sometimes she even sneaks a peek over here."</p><p>"Don't you think it's because I'm handsome?"</p><p>"If you want to say that, I can't argue, but if it were because of your looks, she wouldn't have been so mean to you at the beginning of the semester. She treats everyone rudely, except for you; she becomes as obedient as a neighbor's little sister when she's around you." Zhang Xiao Hou said.</p><p>Mo Fan now attended classes in the morning and practiced cultivation in the afternoon, while wearing his uniform to maintain peace in the city at night. He had no time to speculate about girls' thoughts, and after all, he had the heroic spirit of saving thousands of girls from hardship. Occasionally capturing a few hearts... wasn't that perfectly normal?</p><p>"Look, look, she's coming over to you... Tsk tsk, Fan Brother, I'll be off." Zhang Xiao Hou was indeed a competent teammate, while some friends were as stupid as pigs, insisting on becoming light mages!</p><p>Mo Fan looked up and saw Zhou Min really walking towards him.</p><p>With her small figure, hesitating and hesitant, she seemed somewhat pitiful.</p><p>Zhou Min still looked pretty with her shoulder-length black hair and delicate face, which carried a touch of pride that many girls shared. Although she was mean to boys and kept her distance from them, she couldn't hide her kind heart in everyday life.</p><p>"Mo Fan... do you have time tonight?" Zhou Min walked over and whispered softly.</p><p>Tonight?</p><p>It seemed he still needed to consolidate his Level 2 Thunder Seal skill.</p><p>Zhou Min, Zhou Min, as the class monitor, you should be fully focused on your studies. How could you fall for Fan Brother so quickly? We are all senior three students preparing for the college entrance exam; this year is crucial and affects our future prospects. If we get distracted by early romance, it won't benefit anyone!</p><p>So, Mo Fan nodded and said to Zhou Min, "I have time!"</p><p>Zhou Min immediately smiled and said, "Wait for me after school. I have something important to tell you."</p><p>"No problem." Mo Fan nodded, wondering if he should ask Zhang Xiao Hou to prepare a box of small umbrellas just in case.</p><p>After school, a group of students surged out of the school gate.</p><p>Zhou Min indeed kept her word, waiting for Mo Fan outside the back gate of the school.</p><p>Mo Fan walked over and was just about to speak when Zhou Min said mysteriously, "Mo Fan, I'm not sure if I should tell you about this or who else would be more suitable."</p><p>Mo Fan was rather confused upon hearing that.</p><p>"It's like this: my grandmother lives on Willow Street, which is an old urban area being converted into a new residential district. During the summer vacation, I stayed with her and frequently heard noises from the construction site nearby as if some work crew was operating. However, when I asked around, they all said that they didn't work at night... My grandmother always says that there's something valuable in that sprawling old urban area that is about to become ruins. I tried convincing her to move away, but she doesn't want to leave. So, I hope you'll go with me to check what's going on, otherwise I can't help feeling uneasy leaving my grandmother there alone at night; it really does seem a bit scary," Zhou Min said earnestly to Mo Fan.</p><p>After listening to Zhou Min's description, Mo Fan couldn't help but be taken aback.</p><p>Earthquake at the construction site??</p><p>Dang, not long ago there was an earthquake in the cafeteria, and now there's an earthquake at the construction site. This city of Bocheng is going to be ruined.</p><p>"Could it be another giant-eyed orangutan again?" Mo Fan pondered.</p><p>"Giant-eyed orangutan?? That's a demon! There shouldn't be such things in Bocheng," Zhou Min exclaimed with wide eyes, still shocked by the encounter with the demon last time.</p><p>"Hmm, not that strange. The Hunter Alliance recently reported that giant-eyed orangutans have been acting as if it were mating season, frequently emerging from dark corners and causing a commotion," Mo Fan had seen this happen before.</p><p>If he were still in school, Mo Fan would also think that the city was completely safe and demons couldn't possibly appear there.</p><p>But working with the city's monster hunting team, Mo Fan had accumulated some experience and knowledge.</p><p>How to put it...</p><p>Sigh, we won't be collecting any commission this time, but winning over the girl's heart isn't a bad thing either. Let's just go and take a look!</p><p>...</p><p>Arriving at the Old Banyan Tree District, as Zhou Min said, the entire district had been ravaged by demolition, looking like it had just experienced a severe earthquake.</p><p>It was said that the Old Banyan Tree District was supposed to be transformed into a new commercial district, but due to severe funding shortages from the investors, this part of Bocheng City is now left with ruins that even the government doesn't know how to handle.</p><p>Most people have already moved out of this area. Some homeless people might find temporary shelter in some dangerous buildings, while the rest are elderly residents who still refuse to leave, such as Zhou Min's grandmother.</p>
