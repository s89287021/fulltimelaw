						<p>To the south of Mingwen Girls' School lies a very bustling shopping mall. </p><p>At this time, the mall is usually overrun by a group of aunties, who form a party-like frenzy under the melody of Little Apple.</p><p>Today, the square is eerily empty, and the unyielding aunties may not dare to dance and sing here anymore, for last night they witnessed firsthand as a pack of werewolves devoured their dancing companions.</p><p>The bloodstains have been washed away by the rain, leaving behind only some human limbs on this vast plaza. Staring at them for too long makes one feel sick to their stomach.</p><p>Surrounding the square, low growls and roars can always be heard, occasionally interrupted by screams, signaling that another person has fallen victim to the demons.</p><p>The shopping building occupies nearly a third of the square's area. This newly built mall is now thoroughly ruined due to the demons' rampage, with broken glass, smashed doors, and littered floors everywhere in sight.</p><p>Below ground level on the first floor is Walmart Supermarket. Since human food does not attract demons too much, this place has yet to become a demon gathering spot.</p><p>The supermarket was fortunate enough not to be discovered by the demons, owing to its requirement of taking an elevator to reach it.</p><p>People hiding inside the supermarket sat helplessly on the ground, praying silently that the demons would never find them.</p><p>"Are we going to be abandoned like this?" asked a girl, hugging her knees and sobbing quietly in the corner.</p><p>"The people outside are mostly dead, and it's only a matter of time before we're discovered," said the supermarket manager, slumped there with a numb expression.</p><p>"That won't do; sitting here will only lead to certain death. We have to go out, there might still be a chance for survival," said a man responsible for moving supermarket goods.</p><p>"I'm a plumber and I've been doing this job for decades. Follow me through the underground tunnels, and we won't run into any demons," said a middle-aged thin man in a blue work uniform.</p><p>Upon hearing his words, everyone's eyes lit up.</p><p>According to a teenager who had fled here, demons could be seen everywhere outside, and they would surely be eaten by demons if they went above ground. However, taking the underground tunnels would allow them to easily pass through Mingwen and reach a safe boundary. With a worker familiar with the city's underground drainage system leading the way, they wouldn't get lost underground.</p><p>"Let's go, hurry up; I don't want to stay in this hellhole any longer."</p><p>"Yes, under the blood-red alert, there's little hope of survival if you don't evacuate to a safe zone... "</p><p>"Come on, hurry up. The demons will discover us sooner or later."</p><p>There were about fifteen people in the supermarket. Upon hearing that the pipe worker would lead them, their eyes flickered with a glimmer of hope for survival.</p><p>Fortunately, there was a direct entrance from the supermarket to the underground passage, which offered them a chance to reach the safe zone.</p><p>Everyone quickly gathered their belongings and followed the pipe worker into the underground passage.</p><p>"Wait, wait! Who can help me? There's a girl in a wheelchair here. She probably can't walk..."</p><p>A thin little girl urgently called out to those who were about to leave.</p><p>"Are you insane? It's too late for anyone to care."</p><p>"That's right. We can't take the wheelchair through the sewers, girl. If you want to come, follow us now," said the plump supermarket manager.</p><p>The pipe worker walked ahead, and everyone pretended not to hear him, following closely behind.</p><p>"Then someone carry her, please! Please don't leave her! I beg you!" The thin little girl was close to tears, seeing everyone almost out of sight. She didn't know what to do for a moment.</p><p>A few people turned their heads and showed some compassion towards the girl in the wheelchair, but ultimately turned away...</p><p>They were struggling to protect themselves. If they encountered demons in the underground passage, carrying a girl would make it impossible to escape.</p><p>"Isn't this a bit wrong? The girl looks so pitiful."</p><p>One of the women whispered.</p><p>"What's wrong with it? She can't walk by herself. How is it our fault? If you feel sorry for her, carry her yourself. Don't blame me for not telling you that there are many pipes to climb in the sewers and some ladders will make your legs weak. With her, we might take one or two days to reach the safe zone," said the pipe worker.</p><p>"The supermarket might not be discovered by demons. She can wait there for rescue."</p><p>Hearing about waiting for rescue, everyone's lips twitched involuntarily.</p><p>Under the blood-red alert, there was no possibility of rescue. Most magicians would be summoned to the safety barrier to protect more people's safety. Those still wandering around had to figure out how to evacuate on their own.</p><p>So, the girl in the wheelchair could only pray that the supermarket would never be discovered by demons.</p><p>...</p><p>The supermarket quickly emptied, and the thin girl who had spoken earlier was still standing beside the girl in the wheelchair. She watched those gradually retreating figures, her lips almost biting through.</p><p>"You should go with them," the girl in the wheelchair forced a smile and said to the strange girl beside her.</p><p>"I'm sorry... I really want to take you with me," the thin woman said with great difficulty.</p><p>"It's okay, hurry up and follow them."</p><p>"Is there anything I can do for you?"</p><p>The girl in the wheelchair seemed to have thought of something. She quickly took off her bracelet and handed it to the thin woman: "If you reach the safety barrier, give this to my family..."</p><p>The thin little girl quickly memorized the information about the girl's family members and nodded seriously: "Don't worry, I will inform them and try to find a way to save you."</p><p>The girl in the wheelchair shook her head and said, "Please tell him that I have perished."</p><p>The thin woman opened her mouth in surprise, not knowing what to say for a moment.</p><p>In the end, the thin woman turned around and left. Several times she wanted to turn back but forced herself to continue.</p><p>...</p><p>This indifference was chilling.</p><p>However, what could Jia Qian do? With her injured leg, she could barely keep up with the others, let alone carry the girl in the wheelchair.</p><p>The girl on the cheap wheelchair looked eerily calm. Even as everyone decided to leave her behind, there was not a hint of desperation or panic in her eyes.</p><p>"Sorry, sorry..."</p><p>Jia Qian's lips were bleeding; all she could do was keep apologizing and run after the people who had left.</p><p>In an instant, the supermarket was empty, leaving only a shabby wheelchair and a girl wearing a light green sundress...</p><p>Everyone had gone. Ye Xinxia slowly lowered her head, her hair covering her face. Her pale little hands were folded on her lap.</p><p>No matter how calm she tried to be, that sense of unease still permeated through her, best exemplified by her unconscious grip on the dress.</p><p>She did not blame those people for leaving. Just as she could not walk, who was there to blame? Everyone had the right to live well.</p><p>Yet, when silence around her became terrifying and she had no idea when death would come, that feeling of being abandoned by the entire world overwhelmed every cell in her body. She struggled with whether to continue suffering hopelessly or to end it all, not wanting to linger on this earth any longer?</p><p>Seemingly making a decision, she slowly pushed the wheelchair toward the kitchen area.</p><p>With great effort, she stood up from the wheelchair and grabbed a sharp fruit knife.</p><p>Though she could stand and take a few steps, her weak legs quickly made her exhausted.</p><p>She returned to her previous spot by slowly pushing the wheelchair back...</p><p>...</p><p>Ye Xinxia's actions fell into the eyes of Jia Qian, who was leaving the supermarket. A wave of guilt washed over her again.</p><p>Perhaps this supermarket would end the life of the wheelchair girl herself once it was invaded by demons.</p><p>Jia Qian took a deep breath and finally closed the door.</p>
