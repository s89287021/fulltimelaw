						<p>Mu Ningxue's eyebrows furrowed when she heard this.</p><p>"My adopted son Yuaang is around your age; let him fight you!" Mu Zhuoyun said.</p><p>"Or perhaps..." Mu Ningxue wanted to say more.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun didn't give Mu Ningxue a chance to speak further. He turned to Deng Kai and said, "Deng Kai, I know you like to look after the younger generation, but this brat spoke disrespectfully to me, and you heard that too. I've already backed down by letting him fight my adopted son Yuaang. If he loses, let this brat kneel and apologize until I'm satisfied. If he wins, I'll apologize to him. The incident from three years ago? I Zhuoyun really haven't taken it to heart!"</p><p>Mu Bai and Mu He smiled when they heard this.</p><p>Yuaang, let Yuaang take care of him!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun was indeed cunning; he guessed that Mu Ningxue would step forward mostly to try to get the boy off the hook.</p><p>There was no way Mu Zhuoyun would let Mo Fan off easily, even if Mu Ningxue wanted to help him. He simply couldn't swallow his pride.</p><p>Yuaang was a madman in cultivation within the entire Mu Clan, and just mentioning his name made people shudder. If Yuaang were to fight, he would surely make sure that Mo Fan suffered a grim death!</p><p>"The Magic Association stipulates that both parties in a magic duel must be at least eighteen years old. Therefore, I Deng Kai will serve as the witness, and Mo Fan and Yuaang will have their magic duel on the day they turn eighteen!" Deng Kai said seriously.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun snorted coldly, which was taken as an agreement.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded and said, "Fighting a girl would be a bit too much for me. I'd prefer a guy; he might not even recognize his own father after this!"</p><p>Hearing Mo Fan still being slick-tongued, Mu Zhuoyun was so angry that he puffed out his beard.</p><p>Just wait, an eighteen-year-old magic duel will leave you with nothing but bruises and lost dignity!</p><p>The Magic Association, Hunter Alliance, and Magic Schools protect magic students unconditionally. However, once they turn eighteen, adult mages must take full responsibility for their actions.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun didn't need to deal with a sixteen-year-old brat right now; in two years when he's an adult, he'll make him wish he were dead!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun was already so angry that he left, naturally accompanied by the principal and other several leaders.</p><p>Muning Xue gave Mo Fan a meaningful glance as she left, wanting to say something but not knowing what to say.</p><p>Mo Fan knew that Muning Xue was helping him.</p><p>Having her handle the situation would be much lighter than if Mu Zhuoyun took action. Once someone of Mu Zhuoyun's level got involved, it would cause devastating damage to Mo Fan and his family.</p><p>Unfortunately, her intentions were discovered by her father, Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun knew that Muning Xue would definitely hold back, so he directly replaced her with the most notorious cultivator in the Mu clan, Yu Ang. Mu Yuxiang was completely obedient to Mu Zhuoyun; even if ordered to kill Mo Fan, Yu Ang would not hesitate!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun had no reason to be lenient towards a little thing that dared to curse him like this. He would let him get along well in school for two more years, and once he graduates, there would be trouble waiting for him. For opposing the Mu clan, one could only live until they couldn't take it anymore!</p><p>...</p><p>The storm finally calmed down.</p><p>All the classmates looked at Mo Fan, who had turned into a genius in an instant, recalling his earlier actions, completely at a loss for words.</p><p>This Mo Fan was simply insane!</p><p>Fighting against the Mu family was different from challenging other major magical clans or large families. Any of them could easily crush Tianlan Magic High School...</p><p>Put bluntly, even someone like Mu Bai, a top student at Natural Magic High School, was merely an insignificant side branch in their clan!</p><p>Mo Fan's performance today was indeed shocking, but that didn't mean he had the capital to provoke the colossal Mu family.</p><p>Alas, it was as if he had once leaped from the mortal world to paradise, only to be ruined in an instant with nothing to show for it.</p><p>Who doesn't know that the Mu family of Bocheng is the largest and most powerful clan? Once you offend them, where would one have a place to survive in Bocheng?</p><p>At school, there was the protection of this sacred institution, but once out in society, he would surely be beaten up beyond recognition!</p><p>Arrogance, why must one be so arrogant? So many people had looked forward to this opportunity, only for it to be squandered by Mo Fan's recklessness, thus making a formidable enemy.</p><p>...</p><p>"Fan Brother, you're too handsome. We were all terrified of Old Master Zhuoyun, but you dared to curse the old bastard in front of him several times. Hahaha, actually, many of us have been cursing the old bastard in our hearts as well," said Zhang Xiaohou, who was rather shy but adored his big brother Mo Fan.</p><p>As the neighborhood's kid king, Mo Fan had always commanded respect and obedience in the past. Zhao Kunsan used to hang around with Big Brother Mo Fan, but after that incident, he switched allegiances to Mu Bai. Many others dared not associate with Mo Fan anymore.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou was a die-hard fan of Mo Fan's. No matter how outrageous Mo Fan's actions were, Zhang Xiaohou wholeheartedly approved!</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou knew about the incident three years ago. Seeing Mo Fan's fearless retaliation now filled him with admiration; he had never possessed such courage in his life!</p><p>"Then do you think Mu Ningxue fell for me?" Mo Fan said proudly while raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"Hmm... it's hard to say, Old Bastard is her father after all," Zhang Xiaohou replied.</p><p>"Sigh, I feel so good today. Let's get more scrambled eggs at the cafeteria later." Mo Fan patted Zhang Xiaohou on the shoulder and walked towards the cafeteria with a triumphant smile.</p><p>"Haha, if you saw Mu Bai and Zhao Kunsan's faces just now, you would be even happier," Zhang Xiaohou felt like he had finally vented his frustration.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan, that yes-man, had his face swollen from being beaten up. He never in a million years thought that Mo Fan's cultivation level was far above his own.</p><p>As for Mu Bai, it was no surprise to see him acting like he was the best in the world every day; in the end, he was defeated by the wise and mighty Fan Brother.</p><p>This wasn't even the worst of it. Mu Bai had been groveling before Mu He as if he were a son, hoping that Mu He would help him get into the core lineage of the Mu family to cultivate...</p><p>But the old bastard didn’t even glance at him; instead, he took a fancy to Mo Fan. Most astonishing was that Mo Fan casually threw away something Mu Bai had dreamed of having, which practically slapped the old bastard’s face. What a relief, truly refreshing!</p><p>It boggles the mind how Old Bastard Mu Zhuoyun thought. Three years ago, he should have already learned about Mo Fan’s poisonous tongue and explosive temper. Today, he still dared to try to reconcile and lure him into joining the Mu family, only to be verbally assaulted by Mo Fan who didn’t play by the rules.</p><p>I bet Mu Zhuoyun’s blood pressure must have skyrocketed today!</p><p>"But Fangge, if Old Bastard really were to pack Princess Mu with her dowry as a gift for you and beg you to join the Mu family, would you still reject it?" Zhang Xiahou timidly asked.</p><p>"Of course I would accept!"</p><p>"What the heck, Fangge? Where’s your sense of honor?"</p><p>"Hmm, what you said does seem to have some merit," Mo Fan suddenly stroked his chin, deep in thought.</p><p>"Do you think you lack a sense of honor too?"</p><p>"Get lost. What good is Old Bastard’s apology? It would be better if he packed Mu Ningxue with her dowry and gave her to me as a gift!"</p><p>——————————————————</p><p>(Yesterday I asked for some votes, and it actually worked! We’re only 400 votes away from the homepage recommendation list~~~~~~ They say our chaotic alliance is like a group of elementary school students who only remember book titles but not authors. Do you think I chose such an outrageous pen name for nothing? Come on, continue to threaten me. Don’t you remember that summer when we were waiting by the alley corner after school to extort gaming coins from those little rascals? I’m now just like that cool and aloof guy with a smug expression, waiting for you to shout: Hurry up, give me your recommendation votes!)</p>
