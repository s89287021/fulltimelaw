						<p>Entering the Mu Family Manor, Mo Fan unfortunately overheard Fatty Shi, Leiwenjie, and Cai Tang discussing him. He silently wondered what expressions they would have if they knew that Fan Mo was the same person as Fan Mo.</p><p>Forget it, he thought to himself. I should focus on today's duel.</p><p>He stepped into the grand banquet hall of the Mu Family Manor, where there were indeed numerous delicious foods laid out. Hungry and alone, Mo Fan was about to indulge when he saw a handsome bearded man being surrounded by several young women.</p><p>"Good boy, really daring to attend the feast!" The bearded man glared at Mo Fan.</p><p>"Commander, you're here to mooch food too?" Mo Fan did not expect Commander Zhan Kong to be there as well.</p><p>"Cough cough, how are you talking?" Zhan Kong broke away from the group of young women, pulled Mo Fan aside, raised an eyebrow and asked, "How about it? After graduation, if you join my troops, I can ensure that you get into a good magic university. With my military department backing you, we'll cover your hefty tuition fees. I know you're troublemaker material; with government protection, no second-generation brat will dare to mess with you! We'll even wipe their butts for you!"</p><p>Zhan Kong had tried to recruit Mo Fan into his team before, and whether it was to make him give up the expensive scythe shield remained unclear.</p><p>"No, guarding the border every day is so boring. I'd rather go explore big cities," Mo Fan firmly refused.</p><p>"What's good about big cities? Steel and concrete, exhaust fumes, corruption stench—nothing compares to our Great Relay Station, with its clear waters, lush mountains, pleasant bird songs, and fragrant flowers. If you're unsatisfied with the food, you can hunt a few demons for fresh meat. What freedom!" Zhan Kong said with a grin.</p><p>"I'm definitely not joining the army," Mo Fan stated confidently.</p><p>"Alright, alright, alright. You have principles. If you agree today, Commander will definitely bail you out if anything big happens in the future. Since you're so stubborn, I won't care if that guy named Yu Ang nearly killed you!" Zhan Kong spoke abruptly.</p><p>With his name, Zhan Kong, any young mage would fall at his feet, begging to join his troops. This brat, however, ignored him!</p><p>Just as Mo Fan was about to leave, Zhan Kong placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Commander, what do you mean? I'm not joining your team; are you forcing me?" Mo Fan asked with confusion.</p><p>Zhan Kong had already put away his perverted and handsome uncle act. His brows furrowed in seriousness as he whispered, "You don't have to join my team, but help me out with a little favor."</p><p>"What favor?" Mo Fan was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>"You should pay more attention when dueling with that brat Yuang."</p><p>"What should I pay attention to?"</p><p>"Just be more observant."</p><p>"I don't understand." Mo Fan was just about to ask for clarification when several middle-aged men and women, who seemed to hold important positions, started walking towards them.</p><p>They were clearly old acquaintances of Zhan Kong, who quickly greeted them with a warm smile.</p><p>Mo Fan felt puzzled and had no idea what Zhan Kong wanted him to do.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after, the principal Zhu, Deng Kai, Yang Zuohhe, and other important figures in Bocity all arrived. Mu Zhuoyun personally went to greet them with Yuang.</p><p>Principal Zhu represented the Magic School, the pillar of Bocity's Magic Academy, Tai Shan Bei Dou.</p><p>Deng Kai was the head of the Hunter Alliance, holding an unparalleled status.</p><p>Yang Zuohhe was a representative of the Magic Association, wielding power nearly on par with the previous two.</p><p>On the military side, it was Zhan Kong. This chief instructor could be considered the most powerful mage among these people, the true guardian deity protecting this city of Bocity!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun, as the head of the family lineage, needed no introduction.</p><p>Mo Fan was surprisingly pleased to find that he had already met most of Bocity's important figures, indicating that he might have become somewhat notable?</p><p>In fact, Mo Fan knew he still had a significant gap compared to these seasoned veterans. Due to his student status, if he were exceptionally outstanding, it would be easy for the leaders of these factions to take notice of him. Once he entered society and went through the test of time, they would likely forget about him soon.</p><p>Lu Yunbo, Pan Lijun, and Bai Yang, Mo Fan's instructors, also attended the gathering. According to what the veterans at the station told Mo Fan, these three instructors were slightly more powerful than Team Leader Xu Dahuang of the Monster Hunting Squad, reaching a level very close to that of mid-rank mages.</p><p>In Bocheng, reaching the intermediate mage level is already quite impressive. Any faction would be willing to offer a high position to lure such individuals.</p><p>To put it simply, if Mo Fan were to reach the intermediate mage level, Mu Zhuoyun would never dare to cause him any trouble again. The number of intermediate mages in all of Bocheng could be counted on one hand.</p><p>...</p><p>"Mu Zhuoyun really went big this time, inviting so many people. It seems that everyone with some reputation in Bocheng received an invitation and attended out of respect for Old Zhuoyun." Someone was whispering at the banquet.</p><p>"That's right. With Mu Ningxue coming from the Mu family, her future status will definitely surpass this level. Who doesn't know that Old Zhuoyun is about to rule with absolute power? Today, Mu Zhuoyun is introducing his little sect leader in Bocheng. How can one not come if they want to thrive in Bocheng? Those who don't attend will probably be blacklisted."</p><p>A man who appeared to be from the Magic Association lowered his voice and said.</p><p>"Is it really that exaggerated?"</p><p>"Yes, absolutely. Think about it, how old were we when we reached the intermediate mage level? Now look at Mu Ningxue; she's even younger. From this, you can guess how much control the Mu family will have in Bocheng in the future."</p><p>"So, apart from Chānkōng, who transcends our worldly concerns, everyone has to take Old Zhuoyun seriously. I don't know what that foolish boy Mo Fan is thinking; while we all have to be timid and obedient in front of Old Zhuoyun, he... doesn't want to stay in Bocheng anymore!"</p><p>"Sigh, it's hard to say. I heard that Mu Ningxue and Mu Zhuoyun actually aren't on very good terms. Even if Mu Ningxue says not to bother him, Mu Zhuoyun won't go too far."</p><p>"Yes, and I also heard that this Mo Fan boy is the top student at Tianlan Magic High School. During his training period, he was favored by Chānkōng, so Principal Zhu and Deng Kai would definitely protect such a student. Even if they don't want to offend Mu Zhuoyun, Chānkōng wouldn't have to consider much. Who is Chānkōng afraid of? If anyone dares to mess with his soldiers, he'll kill them on the spot!"</p><p>Fat Stone noticed that the group was discussing this matter and quickly joined in.</p><p>Not long after, when Fat Stone returned, Little Ke asked him curiously, "Brother Fat Stone, why are everyone talking about Yao Ang and this Mo Fan guy?"</p><p>"Oh, I just found out. Mo Fan to some extent represents the power of the Magic School. He will fight Yao Ang, who is a descendant of a noble family, on behalf of the school. The winner naturally gets the extremely valuable opportunity to cultivate at the Sacred Earth Spring."</p><p>"Ah, I heard that no students from the Magic School have entered the Sacred Earth Spring for many years now."</p><p>"That's normal. Schools produce batches of students, and occasionally having one or two prodigies is considered a great harvest. Descendants of noble families are elites; though there aren't as many as in schools, they are all elites. It wouldn't be strange if Mo Fan becomes someone else's stepping stone today."</p><p>"It feels so tragic. The most outstanding student who emerged from a group of 1,500 people still can't match a good family background," Little Ke said mischievously.</p><p>Sigh, being born is a technical skill.</p>
