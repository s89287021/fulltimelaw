						<p>Chao He had already turned his face, and he seemed to have no surprise when he saw Tang Yue. Instead, a sinister smile played on his lips.</p><p>"I think I need to add two more charges, one of which is the murder of the judge," Chao He stared directly at Tang Yue, as if he was about to strip off her soft clothing.</p><p>"There's nothing to say to creatures like you." Tang Yue ignored him and slowly sketched out an outline of a fire-element star chart with her feet.</p><p>"Do you think you can take me down so easily, Miss Tang Yue? Are you too naive?" Chao He's laughter grew more bizarre.</p><p>Tang Yue's expression darkened. Just as she was about to attack, she suddenly noticed a mass of murky substance rapidly surging from the side. It hovered above the small reservoir and quickly formed a cloud-like cluster that obscured the entire area.</p><p>The dense cloud was impenetrable, blocking even a ray of sunlight and devouring the flames emitted by the fire-element spirit seed.</p><p>That region instantly became pitch black.</p><p>Chao He's shadow had completely merged into the darkness, or rather, he didn't cast any shadow at all.</p><p>Chao He could now move. He shook his head and revealed a sinister smile.</p><p>"I forgot to tell you that I've actually sensed you following me for some time now. So, the food you've been pretending to eat as a tourist in the restaurant these past few days has already been tampered with by me," Chao He spoke slowly, showing no sign of being a criminal caught by an enforcer.</p><p>Tang Yue's expression turned solemn again, but she wasn't entirely surprised that he might have one more trick up his sleeve. Given how many times Chao He had escaped the judgment council's warrants, it was clear that he wasn't easy to catch.</p><p>Regarding what Chao He said about putting something in her food, Tang Yue absolutely did not believe him.</p><p>As a judge, if she didn't know whether her food was poisoned, she would be considered an idiot!</p><p>"I know you don't believe me, but you must feel somewhat parched now," Chao He remained unfazed.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Tang Yue involuntarily licked her red lips. In fact, she had long felt her tongue dry, but she hadn't given it much thought, attributing it to the arid environment.</p><p>"It's impossible for a judge to consume poisoned food, so although I am an apothecary, I didn't poison you. Instead, I put something beneficial for your body in your food..." Chao He narrowed his eyes and stared at Tang Yue, who was quite attractive, before continuing slowly, "To put it elegantly, that's something beneficial to women, nourishing blood and yin essence. To put it bluntly... oh, you're already reacting."</p><p>When speaking, Tang Yue gradually changed from her previously parched and dry mouth to a mysterious flush on her cheeks.</p><p>Her blood circulation sped up, and her heart rate increased. Most importantly, she felt something lightly biting at her skin, causing an intense tingling sensation.</p><p>Her breathing slowly became heavy, as if she was gasping out the thirst in her throat. Her entire body felt weak and powerless, yet she felt herself about to uncontrollably pounce on someone's chest like a hungry cat...</p><p>"Shameless! Shameless!!!" Tang Yue finally realized what had been done to her and trembled with humiliation all over.</p><p>"The Council wanted to learn about the origin of the Fountain of Irritability from me, so they sent you, this beautiful female judge, after me. Don't you know that besides being a magician, I am also an outstanding apothecary? Dealing with women is my specialty. Oh, didn't I say I would add two charges: one for killing the judge, and the other... Sssshh, we are all adults; I believe you understand."</p><p>Tang Yue had been extremely careful throughout the entire tracking process. She couldn't understand how this shameless person had detected her.</p><p>Moreover, Tang Yue had always been vigilant, knowing that this person was an apothecary, so she was cautious everywhere, including with what she ate...</p><p>Unfortunately, she had only been wary of harmful things and completely overlooked the fact that Chao He did not poison her at all. Instead, he used something to promote bodily... reactions. No wonder she had felt a certain inexplicable attraction towards Mo Fan when he pressed him against the tree's shadow earlier; it was because she had already been rendered in a state of passion by the drugs.</p><p>Damnit, this damned bastard! Why are there such shameless and despicable people in this world?!!</p><p>...</p><p>Deeper into the forest, after seeing this turn of events, Mo Fan was also deeply shocked: He was an adult too; why didn't he understand?</p><p>At that moment, Mo Fan was also uncertain whether to act immediately or wait for another opportunity.</p><p>Mo Fan definitely wouldn't stand by and watch his beloved Tang Yue teacher be harmed by the villain, but he wasn't sure if he could defeat this deranged opponent.</p><p>"Beast, I will burn you to ashes!!"</p><p>While Mo Fan was grappling with his thoughts, he heard Tang Yue's furious cry.</p><p>Instantly, a torrent of flames radiating heat centered on Tang Yue and spread in all directions. The long hair of the teacher standing within swayed wildly, resembling a magnificent and beautiful phoenix releasing its fury.</p><p>"Phoenix Flame!"</p><p>Tang Yue, standing gracefully amidst the roaring flames, had eyes that displayed an astonishing crimson hue. Her beautiful face exuded a sense of authority, and her red lips spat out her disdain for ugliness and sin!</p><p>"Blazing Fist!"</p><p>The flame's momentum surged another ten feet!</p><p>"Nine Palaces!"</p><p>She finally let out these final words with gravity. Tang Yue's starting pose for releasing the intermediate-level Fire spell was quite familiar to Mo Fan, yet it felt distinctly different!</p><p>Firstly, the flames that Tang Yue controlled were not the ordinary crimson fire seeds one usually saw; she referred to her flames as "Phoenix Flame," which presented a cinnabar-red hue. It was so domineering, as if it had an inherent noble lineage from birth!</p><p>Secondly, her Blazing Fist was not the first-level Heaven-Rending Blazing Fist but had already advanced to the third level!</p><p>Mo Fan had witnessed Phoenix Flames that were truly domineering compared to ordinary flames.</p><p>As for Nine Palaces, when all the heat waves of flames around Tang Yue converged on her right hand and violently struck the ground, Mo Fan finally understood what a Heaven-Rending Blazing Fist Nine Palaces was. The stunning scene left Mo Fan completely stunned!!</p>
