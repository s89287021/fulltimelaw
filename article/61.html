						<p>Fan Mo, your reaction is very quick, and your release speed surprised us greatly. We thought you were the kind of newly graduated mage who would freeze up when seeing demons.</p><p>Li Wenjie walked to Mo Fan's side and gave him a heavy pat on the shoulder.</p><p>"That's right, we thought it would take you half a year before you could be of any use. Who would have thought your mental fortitude is already so good? You even saved Guo Caitang. Guo Caitang, this is the only way I can express my gratitude."</p><p>Feishi laughed and said.</p><p>Mo Fan had no experience or resume to qualify for this position. In fact, their demon-hunting team's recruitment requirements were at least ten demon kills. If Mo Fan was from another faculty, they would never recruit him; even fire mages would not be considered. After all, the demon-hunting team fought demons in urban areas. Other hunters who could not defeat demons often ended up dead themselves. The demon-hunting team failing to take down a demon might affect the city's helpless residents.</p><p>City demon-hunting teams had greater responsibilities, so their members naturally had to be elite among hunter mages.</p><p>Considering the rarity of lightning mages and the power of their skills, they were willing to spend half a year training a complete novice. Mo Fan was seen as an absolute novice in everyone's eyes; encountering demons, he might not even be able to cast his skills properly.</p><p>Who would have thought that just now, he flawlessly completed the Lightning Seal skill? His reaction speed and proficient control of star orbits made their demon-hunting team look at him with new respect!</p><p>Especially Guo Caitang, who initially scolded this novice, Mo Fan, only to be saved by him in a critical moment. Her emotions were extremely complicated.</p><p>"Alright, Li Wenjie, Feishi, you two go check the cafeteria. If there are no more demons, the remaining tasks can be left to the police. I hope that girl is still alive," Xu Dahan said.</p><p>"OK!"</p><p>Search and rescue operations required a large number of people. The demon-hunting team's main task was to eliminate potential threats. Next, Feishi and Li Wenjie could work with the police to search for the missing Lin Yun'er.</p><p>It had already been a week, though, and the girl's chances of survival were very slim.</p><p>"Hum~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Just as Mo Fan was about to leave, Xiaoniyu suddenly emitted a vibration.</p><p>"Remnant soul?!"</p><p>Mo Fan was overjoyed and rushed to the body of the Giant Eye Baboon.</p><p>A ghostly blue light, resembling that of a firefly, appeared on the baboon's body. Small like a candle flame, it seemed summoned and slowly floated towards Mo Fan's pendant around his neck.</p><p>Others were busy with their own matters and did not notice this scene. Mo Fan successfully inhaled the remnant soul of the giant-eyed squirrel into his Little Mudskipper Pendant.</p><p>The Little Mudskipper Pendant possessed the ability to automatically collect remnant souls, just like it had absorbed the remnant soul of the ghost wolf beast during their previous encounter.</p><p>Unfortunately, for the pendant to truly grow, it seemed that something more refined than remnant souls was needed—perhaps essence souls. It was uncertain whether collecting remnant souls would have any effect; further research was required.</p><p>Moreover, both the Magic Association and the Hunter Alliance sold remnant souls for around 10,000 units each. If sufficient remnant souls could indeed promote growth in the pendant, it might be worthwhile to use some of the money earned from hunting demons to purchase these remnant souls. The priority was to get the Little Mudskipper Pendant to reach Spirit level so that Mo Fan could upgrade Huo Zhi to Huo Zhi? Explosive Incineration within a year!</p><p>"Hmm? ?The lightning starlets seem to be showing some changes. Could it be...?" Suddenly, Mo Fan noticed his lightning stardust's starlets were incredibly excited.</p><p>Their excitement was reminiscent of when the fire starlets had changed previously, leading to Huo Zhi? Scorching becoming Huo Zhi? Bone Burning.</p><p>This meant that the Lightning Seal would soon level up as well!!!</p><p>After prolonged meditation, the lightning starlets had shown no signs of movement until today's swift release caused their transformation. It was unclear whether this change stemmed from the recent battle or the absorption of the remnant soul?</p><p>Huo Zhi was already at Bone Burning. The effect of the Lightning Seal advancing to its second level from its initial state was uncertain, and it was something Mo Fan looked forward to.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan was unexpectedly pleased to find that he had earned a commission for completing his first task.</p><p>The school had spent 200,000 units to have the City Demon Hunting Team handle this matter. Mo Fan received 10% of this sum. As a newcomer, he would typically receive an internship wage with a nominal commission as a gesture. Given Mo Fan's unique lightning affinity and his remarkable performance today, the team had decided to promote him directly.</p><p>Ten percent equaled exactly 20,000 yuan, which was equivalent to what his father earned from driving for nearly six months!</p><p>Mo Fan carefully saved this money, reserving it for future needs.</p><p>This could be considered Mo Fan's first windfall. Although risky, the reward far exceeded his expectations, making it more lucrative than hunting demons elsewhere. No wonder so many people were eager to join the City Demon Hunting Team.</p><p>Mu's Estate</p><p>The serene private swimming pool shimmered with layers of gentle ripples. Mu Gua, wearing a swim cap, swam to the shore and lay wet on the lounge chair under the umbrella. He glanced at the female private swimming instructor beside him, whose skin had a dark mahogany hue; his gaze casually swept across her half-exposed rounded chest.</p><p>"Crackling~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Just as Mu Gua was about to speak, he noticed that the pool's water slowly began to be covered with a layer of cold frost. The surface of the swimming pool quickly froze over.</p><p>"Don't... I'll swim in a moment." Mu Gua felt a headache coming on; before he could finish speaking, the entire pool turned as cold as winter, leaving him speechless and amused.</p><p>"Uncle He, my father wants you to come over," said a tall, slender man with an unusually gloomy expression.</p><p>"He Yuang, your ice-star dust is getting stronger. How's your cultivation coming along?" Mu Gua asked amiably.</p><p>"Some progress, but not much," replied the youth named He Yuang.</p><p>"You call that slow..." Mu Gua chuckled. "Others are only at level 1 of Ice Vine, while you've already mastered Ice Vine Condensation. At this rate, you'll reach level 3, Ice Vine Coverage, within two years. That's massive frost spreading over a wide area. Not just some puny fire student; with one go, you could freeze an entire region!"</p><p>"Two years? That's still too long," He Yuang muttered to himself.</p><p>"You always feel unsatisfied with your cultivation. In reality, you're already far ahead of your peers. While there is still a gap between you and Mu Ningxue, remember that she's special. You know how Zhuo Yun harbors resentment towards him. After a year, when you naturally dispose of that brat, he'll likely bestow you with a great gift," Mu Gua said with a chuckle.</p><p>"I don't give that clown any thought," He Yuang stated.</p>
