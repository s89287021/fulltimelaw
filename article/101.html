						<p>"Hmm."</p><p>"Where is he now?"</p><p>"I have no idea either. I left him to escape on his own into the safety barrier," Lin Yuxin said.</p><p>When Lin Yuxin mentioned that the Holy Spring of Earth had not fallen into the hands of the Black Cathedral, Yang Zuohé looked relieved. However, upon learning that the Holy Spring of Earth was in the hands of a student with an unknown fate, he fell into despair.</p><p>"Mr. Yang, why does the Black Cathedral want the Holy Spring of Earth? What was their purpose in summoning demons to attack Bocity this time?" Lin Yuxin asked.</p><p>"Our purpose for destroying Bocity is still unclear, but they want the Holy Spring of Earth to completely wipe out Bocity," Yang Zuohé said with a hint of anger in his voice.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"The Holy Spring of Earth has always been a heavenly treasure of thousands of years, offering tremendous temptation even to demon leaders. They have already triggered this disaster by torturing Young Wyverns and unleashing the Wrathful Rain. However, Wyverns alone are not enough to destroy Bocity. They plan to release the enormous aura of the Holy Spring of Earth to lure other demon leaders into attacking Bocity. Demons naturally crave treasures that can greatly increase their power, so once the aura of the Holy Spring of Earth is released, all the demon leaders within a hundred kilometers will sense it. The defenses of Bocity are already on the brink of collapse. Those demon leaders with some level of intelligence will surely take advantage of this opportunity, turning Bocity into a hell on earth at that time," Yang Zuohé said.</p><p>Lin Yuxin shuddered at his words.</p><p>The Black Cathedral was too ruthless and insane. Summoning a Wyvern leader and its pack was one thing; summoning even more demon leaders was their way of turning Bocity into a city of corpses!</p><p>"We have to find that student named Mo Fan before the Black Cathedral does," Yang Zuohé said with great solemnity.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I didn't know that the Holy Spring of Earth would have such a huge impact..."</p><p>"You made the right choice. At least having the Holy Spring of Earth in that student's hands means it hasn't fallen into the hands of the Black Cathedral." Yang Zuohé could only pray silently at that moment, hoping they wouldn't find Mo Fan.</p><p>"It doesn't look good. The people from the Black Cathedral have likely guessed that I gave the Holy Spring of Earth to Mo Fan and should already be searching for his whereabouts throughout the city," Lin Yuxin said in a calm voice.</p><p>"There's no time to lose; we need to find Mo Fan."</p><p>"If he gets eaten by demons, wouldn't it be better if the demons got the Holy Spring of Earth rather than the Black Cathedral?" Lin Yuxin suddenly asked.</p><p>Yang Zuohé was taken aback.</p><p>"The saying goes..."</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>"Hao Chou!!"</p><p>In Mingyuan City District, Mo Fan, who was just walking along, suddenly sneezed.</p><p>Rubbing his nose, Mo Fan couldn't explain why he did that; perhaps someone was thinking of him.</p><p>The appearance of the Bone Spike Hyena, a War General-level creature, severely impeded their progress. They only dared to continue forward with renewed courage after waiting until that terrifying beast had moved far away.</p><p>Having two Lightning Mages in one team indeed provided formidable combat power. As long as they were not caught unprepared, they could generally minimize danger.</p><p>"We're almost there, we're almost there! Great, did you see the barrier light screen that rises up like the city walls? It's right over there!" Zhang Xiaohou said excitedly from atop an electricity pole.</p><p>This three-kilometer death route was indeed too difficult for these magic students who had yet to graduate. Now that they were about to reach a safe area, they were naturally elated.</p><p>"Don't let your guard down; we still have six hundred meters left," Mo Fan said.</p><p>The Nine People continued forward. Ahead of them was a stinky city moat.</p><p>The riverbed wasn't very wide, with willow trees planted on both sides. The originally neat rows of sunshade coffee houses were now in complete disarray.</p><p>In the foul-smelling river, there were one or two giant-eyed beavers. Fortunately, they did not stay for long and swam away into the distance.</p><p>Nine people cautiously crossed the bridge, which was clearly damaged, probably from a battle between a magician and a demon. Some embers of fire still burned at the bottom of the bridge.</p><p>"De…Demon!" Just as they reached the middle of the bridge, a deep blue wolf-like creature suddenly appeared on the other side.</p><p>Unlike the one-eyed demon wolf that stood semi-upright, this azure creature was on all fours, with its fur bristling up from behind its head to its neck and shoulders, clearly different from the vicious one-eyed demon wolf they had seen before.</p><p>Everyone was initially shocked, but upon closer inspection, they discovered a man sitting on the back of the shadow wolf and immediately broke into joyful smiles, especially the students.</p><p>"Commander Bai, that's Commander Bai!!"</p><p>"It's great to meet someone from the military here," Xue Mucheng said with a sense of relief.</p><p>Mo Fan looked around and saw that the person riding the shadow wolf was none other than their former instructor Bai Yang, one of the special summoning mages who had provided them training. It was even the same shadow wolf Mo Fan had killed earlier.</p><p>Bai Yang seemed to have more than one shadow wolf… unfortunately, this one was slightly smaller and less imposing compared to the one Mo Fan had slaughtered.</p><p>"How did you end up here? Didn't you evacuate immediately?" Bai Yang rode his shadow wolf towards them.</p><p>Wang Sanpang, Xu Shaoting, He Yu, and others looked at Commander Bai's elegant control over the shadow wolf with even more admiration.</p><p>Summoning mages are just cool; they can ride even demons. In a city where transportation was completely paralyzed, a nimble shadow wolf could be more valuable than anything else.</p><p>"Tiulan Magic High School didn't evacuate immediately due to the large number of people. The main force is about one kilometer behind us and is following our advance team towards the safety barrier," Xue Mucheng explained.</p><p>"Oh, I'll notify the general to send additional troops to protect them. You all wait here with me; there are a few troublesome demons ahead," Bai Yang took off his cap and smiled warmly.</p><p>"Commander Bai, you have no idea how many dangers we've faced on this journey. Unfortunately, Zhang Yinglu was killed. Fortunately, Mo Fan has extensive experience dealing with demons, or we might not have made it this far," Wang Sanpang couldn't stop talking to Bai Yang.</p><p>Seeing the instructor here, everyone naturally felt a bit relieved, after all, this summoning-type instructor's combat power exceeded that of a demon. If he had more summoned creatures, he could even handle several demons without any problem.</p><p>"Oh? Mo Fan!" Bai Yang showed obvious signs of movement on his face, his gaze immediately falling on Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan was puzzled, wondering why Bai Yang was staring at him like that.</p><p>Bai Yang jumped down from the shadow wolf beast and quickly walked to Mo Fan's side. His eyes were fixed on Mo Fan as he said, "We have all been looking for you."</p>
