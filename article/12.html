						<p>"By the way, Xu Bing, don't you have a bit of a heavy taste? This little girl may look good, but... whether she can or not is another matter." The young man said, holding a cigarette in his mouth.</p><p>"I agree with him too."</p><p>"There are plenty of pretty middle school girls out there. They're stupid and rich, easy to intimidate. Why fuss over just one...?"</p><p>"You guys know nothing about taste," Xu Bing fiercely glared at the group.</p><p>Just as he was annoyed by their poor taste, Xu Bing raised his head and saw a boy wearing a black shirt walking towards the pavilion with an icy expression.</p><p>"Huh? This guy looks familiar..."</p><p>Damn it, talking about Cao Cao, Cao Cao arrives. Isn't this kid the older brother of the little girl next door!</p><p>Well, I've been wanting to deal with you for obstructing my attempts at dating so many times. Didn't expect you to come to me on your own. Since all my brothers are here today, let's give you a taste of what it means to be beaten up and make sure you never stick your nose out again!</p><p>"Brothers, draw your weapons!" Xu Bing abruptly stood up, his gaze locking with Mo Fan's cold eyes.</p><p>The jeans-clad man, the cigarette-smoking youth, the cap-wearing man, and the down jacket-clad man all stood up quickly, looking around...</p><p>"Big brother, we didn't bring any weapons," the cigarette-smoking youth whispered to Xu Bing weakly.</p><p>"F*ck you, do you need a weapon to deal with this little guy? Beat him to death for me! Zhao Kun's three brothers have ordered it. If he gets crippled, it's on his head!" Xu Bing slapped the chattering subordinate across the forehead in anger.</p><p>The cigarette-smoking subordinate looked wronged; clearly it was you who said to draw weapons... turns out it was just a figure of speech.</p><p>"Since Zhao Kun's three brothers have ordered it... hahaha!" The down jacket-clad man quickly took off his jacket, revealing a white undershirt with exaggerated muscles popping out!</p><p>Mo Fan stared at the five so-called members of Green Bear Gang as if they were animals.</p><p>...</p><p>"Hmph, brat, let me tell you this. A girl like your sister, it’s her lifetimes’ good fortune that I, Xu Bing, would take an interest in her. Do you think everyone is as indifferent as I am to the fact that she’s... a... a... disabled person? Why should such a disabled person act all saintly? If anyone wants her, they’d be quick to offer sacrifices and pray to Buddha!!" Xu Bing pointed at Mo Fan, revealing his true colors!</p><p>These years, Xu Bing had long run out of patience.</p><p>Didn’t he have looks and power? In this vast Guangchi District, he was a notable figure. After Ye Xinxia joined him, she could live comfortably and he would have loyal subordinates by his side!</p><p>"Yeah, don’t be so ungrateful!"</p><p>"Now behave and call me uncle. For the sake of family, we’ll spare you lightly and just give Zhao Kunsan and Mu Bai an account of it. If you’re stubborn, we’ll break your legs and make you accompany her in a wheelchair!" said the fitness guy wearing a white vest.</p><p>Upon hearing these words, Mo Fan’s chest heaved violently.</p><p>He glanced at the pavilion.</p><p>In the center of the pavilion lay a lonely wheelchair with scattered playing cards on it.</p><p>When he first saw those trash treating Ye Xinxia's wheelchair as a card table, he was already furious. Now, hearing Xu Bing’s extremely insulting words, Mo Fan felt his chest about to explode!!</p><p>Disabled??</p><p>DISABLED?????</p><p>I, Mo Fan, have sworn that whoever dares to say another word against Ye Xinxia will regret ever being born into humanity!</p><p>"Don’t waste time on this brat. Beat him up!"</p><p>"I can handle it alone. You guys just watch." The fitness guy in the white vest started clenching his fists, making a grating sound.</p><p>Mo Fan looked at them with eyes as cold as ice.</p><p>What these street thugs didn’t notice was that within his pupils, a purple lightning fury trace was reflecting. Under Mo Fan’s anger, the star orbit containing immense lightning power was transforming into an erupting volcano!!</p><p>"Didn't you really think I was still that Mo Fan who could be cut down at will??"</p><p>A surging force danced in the air around Mo Fan. They were like soldiers fully armed but waiting for orders from their general!</p><p>"Just right, let these beasts taste the power of lightning!"</p><p>Anger roared out from his throat. At this moment, seven stars aligned into a line, forming a star trajectory that infused all the power within the Lightning System's stardust into Mo Fan's right arm!</p><p>"Zzzzzzzzzz~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A breathtaking bolt of lightning flashed past Mo Fan like a python, and in the next second, the agitated lightning elements in the air crazily gathered on his right arm, emitting an ear-piercing cry!</p><p>"Oh my God!!!!!"</p><p>"What is this???"</p><p>"Why is there crackling around his body as if he's been electrocuted!"</p><p>"This kid… oh my God, he's a magician!!" Xu Bing was indeed the most experienced among them. The word "magician" was almost slipping out of his mouth!</p><p>They were indeed very well-known hooligans in the Guangchi District, but even hooligans relied on fist fights and kicks. In front of a real magician, they weren't even worth a speck of dust!!</p><p>"How could he possibly be a magician!!"</p><p>Xu Bing and his group of five were scared out of their wits by the mind-blowing scene before them.</p><p>To them, punching a tree to leave an impression was considered extremely powerful among hooligans. They had never seen someone wrapped in crackling arcs of electricity, with several meters around him resembling a destroyed high-voltage zone, and the invisible force making their entire bodies tingle!</p><p>"Lightning Power, Lightning Seal!!"</p><p>The arm suddenly raised, palm facing upwards.</p><p>All the lightning arcs dancing in the surrounding air emitted a sharp sound, as if a group of element warriors clad in purple armor were responding to an order and swiftly drawing their weapons!</p><p>"Eliminate them!" Filled with rage, Mo Fan was completely dominated by an instinctive feeling that controlled these obedient bolts of lightning.</p><p>His palm clenched fiercely!</p><p>Arcs of lightning elements were released in full force, rushing towards the area where Xu Bing and the bodybuilder stood!</p><p>The lightning arcs fell from above, each strike resembling a giant whip slamming into Xu Bing and the muscular bodybuilder, leaving snake-like marks on the ground!!!</p><p>"Zzzzzzz~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Xu Bing and the bodybuilder were completely knocked to the ground by the lightning strikes. Just moments ago they had been acting composed, but after the lightning imprints descended, their backs split open, charred on the outside yet tender inside...</p><p>They wanted to scream in agony, but even a cry of pain was stifled. The power attached to the lightning imprints felt like tiny pythons writhing on their bodies, each movement causing Xu Bing and the bodybuilder to convulse in intense pain!</p><p>"Ploosh!!" Overwhelmed by this terrifying demonic force, the young man smoking a cigarette fell to his knees, shivering uncontrollably!</p><p>The hooligan dressed in jeans stood frozen like a statue.</p><p>The man wearing a hat stood there unharmed by the lightning imprints, yet his jeans were completely soaked through and dripping onto his shoes!</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>(%!(EXTRA string=Today I went out with my computer and only realized that my manuscript wasn't on the notebook. This is even more frustrating than not having internet access. That's why I'll update for everyone tonight... Well, I think I shouldn't have pretended to be someone who would always update regularly in my new book. Anyway, there will be another chapter later))</p>
