						<p>"Hahaha~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>The leaves and broken branches of the old banyan tree danced chaotically as they fell.</p><p>"Yuan, hurry, release another layer of ice vines!" Guo Caitang immediately realized something and hurriedly told Yuan.</p><p>"It's not possible, my breathing is being suppressed by its overwhelming aura," Yuan said.</p><p>Mo Fan also felt that surge of bestial fury washing over him like a tidal wave. As the one-eyed werewolf howled towards the sky, this raging aura kept rolling in, causing the houses in this old district to sway violently.</p><p>"It's advancing! This monster is cornered by us and is forcing itself to advance!"</p><p>"Having absorbed energy from the Sacred Spring of Earth, it already possesses the capital to advance. We must stop it; if it succeeds in advancing, even Yang Zuohé rushing over might not be able to subdue it!!" Xu Dahuang's face was extremely grim.</p><p>Having served in the city monster-hunting team for so long, this was Xu Dahuang's first encounter with a demon in its advancement stage.</p><p>Demons in their advancement stages were not scary; what was truly terrifying were those who successfully advanced. Those were by no means something that these novice mages could withstand!</p><p>Moreover, once it started slaughtering recklessly, the residents of this entire district would suffer catastrophic losses!</p><p>"We can't stop it, we should flee while it hasn't completed its advancement," Li Wenjie said with a pale face.</p><p>A successfully advanced demon was simply too fast for Li Wenjie to handle, and everyone present would die. It wouldn't take more than 10 seconds for this successfully advanced one-eyed werewolf to kill them all!</p><p>"What nonsense are you talking about? Turn around and look at what's behind you!" Xu Dahuang roared in anger.</p><p>This area had been abandoned due to the construction site, and the banyan tree street was in a half-demolished state. However, beyond this old banyan tree street lay the bustling commercial district with its neon lights flashing.</p><p>There were families sitting in the hall watching TV, girls preparing small gifts for Valentine's Day, elderly couples strolling leisurely, residential buildings, shops, entertainment venues, squares...</p><p>Where did these people have any ability to defend themselves??</p><p>It can be certain that if they turn and leave now, the advanced Monoculus Wolf will urgently need a large amount of food, and those people will become its prey.</p><p>There are indeed more powerful mage guilds in this city than their monster hunting team, but it is impossible for mid-level mages to remain vigilant all the time. Even if they reach here at their fastest speed to eliminate this Monoculus Wolf, they cannot avoid the rampant slaughter during this period.</p><p>How many lives will be lost, Xu Dahan might not be able to calculate.</p><p>"Although that little brat is very annoying, he did an impressive thing today by discovering this Monoculus Wolf about to advance. This has prevented a greater disaster. However, we don't need to say such pessimistic things; it hasn't advanced successfully yet, and we can stop it!" Guo Caitang said with a mournful smile.</p><p>Xu Dahan no longer planned to run.</p><p>To be honest, the captain of this monster hunting team's demeanor made Mo Fan admire him.</p><p>"Fattish Shi, prepare an earthquake wave? Slow down; if it breaks free from the ice vines, we must not allow it to run away," Xu Dahan said.</p><p>Fattish Shi nodded.</p><p>He suddenly slapped his palm on the cement ground, and ripples resembling lake waves appeared on the surface. These ripples moved in one direction, forcing the frozen Monoculus Wolf to move farther away from everyone.</p><p>However, the effect of the ice vines could not last much longer.</p><p>A boiling heat began forcefully evaporating the surrounding frost into water, even making some of it boil.</p><p>"This thing is really advancing; its body and blood vessels are scorching hot!" Fattish Shi said with an uneasy expression.</p><p>Li Wenjie clenched his teeth, unsure what to do.</p><p>In plain terms, if this Monoculus Wolf successfully advances, none of them would survive. They could not even stop the monster from entering that bustling commercial district.</p><p>Staying here was equivalent to waiting for death.</p><p>Moreover, the signs of this Monoculus Wolf's advancement were already quite obvious. Why stay here and wait for death??</p><p>"It has to break free!" Li Wenjie said, his face drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Damn it, there’s no time to run now.</p><p>Xu Dahan, Xiaoke, Fat Stone, and Guo Caitang all showed no sign of leaving.</p><p>Mo Fan was also watching the one-eyed demon wolf intently. He could clearly see that its muscles had become somewhat translucent, with blood vessels inside clearly visible. They were scorching hot and rapidly flowing through the demon wolf’s body!</p><p>The bones of the one-eyed demon wolf were cracking loudly; the bone tissue at its shoulder even grew directly out from the muscle, becoming a sharp shoulder blade.</p><p>Its spine, resembling that of a giant, was also growing, piercing through the muscles on its back. The bloody bones transformed into a spine covered in spines, looking even more fierce and terrifying under the cold moonlight!</p><p>"Fire Burst!!"</p><p>Xu Dahan could no longer stay calm; he gathered a ball of flame tinged with anger and hurled it at the monster.</p><p>“Boom~~~~!”</p><p>The flames exploded before the one-eyed demon wolf, engulfing it in a surge of fire. The street was bathed in red light from the blaze.</p><p>A wave of heat filled the old street, causing the ancient banyan tree to catch fire and begin spreading to the old buildings.</p><p>Everyone had long fled the old buildings; both sides of the houses were in ruins after the explosion.</p><p>Such ferocity must have inflicted some damage on the one-eyed demon wolf.</p><p>When the flames finally subsided, a figure still enveloped in flames leaped out from the explosion site, colliding with everything in its path…</p><p>"Captain, be careful!!" Fat Stone shouted.</p><p>Xu Dahan’s face was filled with shock.</p><p>It withstood a fire explosion and the one-eyed werewolf actually emerged unscathed!!</p><p>"Earthwave!!"</p><p>Fat Stone desperately cast his skill.</p><p>He controlled the ground, hoping that the undulating surface would pull back the charging one-eyed werewolf. However, the one-eyed werewolf was truly too fast; this backward-pulling earthwave had no significant effect!</p><p>"Eeeeeeee!!!!!!!"</p><p>The one-eyed werewolf, still burning with flames, leaped up, its chest bulging with power. The claws stretched backwards sliced through the night air like a cold blade, aiming for Captain Xu Dahan.</p><p>"Water Control? Guardian!"</p><p>Xiao Kai completed her star orbit just in time, and several water ribbons quickly wove into a suit of armor that landed on Captain Xu Dahan's body.</p><p>The fierce claws swept across, piercing through this Water Control Guardian.</p><p>A spray of blood spurted out, revealing a long gash on Captain Xu Dahan's body. The terrifying sight was like he had been gutted open directly!!!</p>
