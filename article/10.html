						<p>"Come, come, form a line and count off!"</p><p>Mo Fan calmed himself and focused intently on attempting to control all seven stars simultaneously!</p><p>The first star was the most obedient; after all, it had been lovingly caressed every day. At Mo Fan's command, this lively star immediately stopped its activity and remained stationary in the center of the stardust.</p><p>The second star showed a bit of stubbornness, reluctantly following behind to align with the first star.</p><p>Following closely behind were the third, fourth, fifth...</p><p>The sixth star was very obedient, eagerly joining the lineup.</p><p>Oh my goodness, only one more!</p><p>Mo Fan concentrated intensely, directing all his mental energy towards the seventh star.</p><p>The seventh star was speeding through the stardust. After hearing Mo Fan's mental call, it gradually came to a stop, somewhat impatiently and unhappily, slowly integrating into the stellar orbit...</p><p>god-boy, god-boy!!</p><p>Seeing that the seventh star had a tendency to be subdued, Mo Fan became slightly excited.</p><p>If the first six stars were like obedient dogs, responding to his commands by sitting still, then this seventh star was like a cat, exuding an air of aloofness and impatience...</p><p>Since you want me to stop, I'll reluctantly comply.</p><p>Slowly, slowly...</p><p>The seventh star finally came to a halt, aligning with the other six stars.</p><p>In an instant, a breathtakingly beautiful stellar orbit emerged within the magnificent stardust. This orbit radiated violet star energy like thunder, using the first star as a medium, resembling a meteor that dragged out a long, purple, elegant tail, sweeping past the other six stars!!</p><p>Star tracks appear!</p><p>Magic manifests!</p><p>Sitting at the very back of the bus, Mo Fan, wearing a black shirt, suddenly found himself enveloped by a curved trajectory. Purple stardust flashed past, bestowing an indescribable power upon him.</p><p>"Thunder Seal!!!"</p><p>"It's the Thunder Seal!!!"</p><p>Mo Fan was overjoyed, unable to contain his laughter and raising his head skyward!</p><p>"Sizzzzzz~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>On his right hand, it felt as if a python coiled around his arm. The purple power of the Thunder Seal was gathered in Mo Fan’s hand, ready to unleash a lightning stampede towards the center of the bus at any moment he waved his hand.</p><p>"Oh my God!!!"</p><p>"Magician! It's a magician!!"</p><p>"It's even a Lightning Mage... ah, I feel numb all over."</p><p>A chorus of exclamations filled the bus. The old woman who had just bought groceries, the elderly man returning home after exercising, the girl engrossed in her phone, and the pervert molesting his phone were all utterly shocked at Mo Fan sitting at the back.</p><p>"G-Great Mage, I...I won’t dare again next time, I promise! Please spare me, I didn't recognize Your Eminence..."</p><p>Suddenly, the perverted girl’s middle-aged maniac knelt to the ground in terror, tears and snot streaming as he pleaded with Mo Fan for mercy.</p><p>The middle-aged pervert thought that this young magician had unleashed his thunderous power due to witnessing his indecent behavior.</p><p>This thunderous force was incredibly terrifying. Everyone in the bus was so shocked by the lightning energy that they felt numb all over, especially that lecherous man, whose hand was rapidly losing sensation!</p><p>"I’ll spare your life this time, but if I catch you again, I'll disable your hand!" Mo Fan stood up abruptly, looking down sternly at the pervert.</p><p>"Yes, yes, I won't do it again next time, I promise." Having said that, the pervert quickly rolled out of the car when the driver stopped.</p><p>The surrounding aunts and uncles immediately praised him, while several teenagers who clearly hadn't finished middle school shot Mo Fan admiring glances.</p><p>"Mommy, my brother is so amazing. Can I be as strong as him one day?" A seven- or eight-year-old child tugged on his mother's skirt and asked weakly.</p><p>"A magician isn't something everyone can become, especially a lightning mage."</p><p>Mo Fan realized that his magic had caused a commotion in the entire car. To avoid trouble, he hastily got out of the vehicle.</p><p>By the roadside, Mo Fan couldn't calm down.</p><p>Holy crap, how awesome was that!!!</p><p>Recalling the terrifying sensation of wrapping his arm with the Lightning Seal and effortlessly destroying someone with a wave of his hand—something unprecedented, like a dream!!!</p><p>Is this magic??</p><p>THIS IS MAGIC!!!!</p><p>Mo Fan's heart pounded. Even though the Lightning Seal hadn't actually been released earlier, he already felt the power of thunder surging through him. He could control it at will, giving him strength he had never imagined.</p><p>The respect from everyone in the car, the pervert kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy, and the miraculous aura around his arm...</p><p>This was an unparalleled sense of exhilaration and incredulity!!</p><p>"Hahaha, I've learned the Lightning Seal. It only took me one semester! Now, who can stop me? Mu Bai, Zhao Ting—everyone will have to grovel before me!"</p><p>In just one semester, Mo Fan had mastered the Lightning Seal. In fact, the school was supposed to give students a whole year.</p><p>From the start of the semester to now, Mo Fan had used only five months. If this were revealed, his classmates and teachers, not to mention the entire school, would probably be stunned!!</p><p>It seemed not long ago that Professor Zhang Jianguo was still boasting about his proud disciple Huang Mingkai being able to control four stars... Mu Bai also had four stars.</p><p>Hahaha, I have already released the Thunder Seal. How dare you, this green-tea boy Mu Bai, challenge me, your grandpa?!</p><p>I could already feel the thunderous power surging out just by holding the Thunder Seal in my arm. I couldn't even imagine what it would be like when fully released; just thinking about it made me somewhat excited.</p><p>Take a deep breath, take a deep breath. Don't act like a 2B on the street laughing. Stay calm; you are already an amazing mage!</p><p>Mou Fan actually wanted to use the Thunder Seal again, but after completing it earlier, he felt a dizzying emptiness in his body.</p><p>"This must be what Teacher meant by mental energy consumption?" Mou Fan muttered to himself.</p><p>Generally speaking, when practicing control, Mou Fan could maintain it for two hours before feeling mentally fatigued.</p><p>Just now on the bus, he had practiced controlling for at most 20 minutes, but upon completing the Thunder Seal, he felt his abundant mental energy drained as if by an instant...</p><p>Mou Fan could still understand this. During practice, as long as no complete star orbit was formed, blue mana consumption was usually minimal. However, once a star orbit was connected and celestial power was transmitted to one's body to achieve magical effects, almost half of the blue mana would be used up!</p><p>He had never been a mage before, but he played Legend of Miracles and League of Legends, which was the same principle, the same principle!</p>
