						<p>This was not the first time Mo Fan had heard of the Earth Holy Spring. It seemed that the one-eyed magic wolf back then almost advanced to a higher level after stealing some of the spring's energy. Clearly, this Earth Holy Spring must be a rare treasure in Bocity, so valuable that even demons were willing to risk entering human territory to steal it.</p><p>"Of course, our Bocity does have certain special resources specifically allocated for students about to enter the Magic University... Unfortunately, the Earth Holy Spring is an extremely limited resource; we can only provide one student with access per year. This student is not selected solely from within the school; children of noble families and clans also compete for it," said Principal Zhu.</p><p>At this point, Deng Kai couldn't help but smile bitterly. "Principal Zhu, we haven’t obtained that exclusive qualification in many years now, feeling like our clan’s children have cornered it all."</p><p>"It's not surprising. Noble families can focus their resources on an outstanding child and provide them with training and cultivation that a big institution like ours cannot offer," said Principal Zhu calmly, as if he had long since accepted the situation.</p><p>"Mo Fan, you don't need to take this competition too seriously. It’s good for you to realize the strength of noble children early on so that you can remain calm and work harder in your future cultivation path. As for Mu Clan's revenge against you, you don’t have to worry too much. Once you enter the Magic University, their influence will be limited. Even if you stay in Bocity, we would still be willing to continue grooming you," Deng Kai explained.</p><p>After hearing the words of his teachers, Mo Fan felt somewhat moved.</p><p>No wonder Principal Zhu and Deng Kai were so respected by students and parents; they had always stood up for ordinary students, protecting them even under pressure from noble families. This was truly commendable, considering how many public school principals sought to curry favor with influential figures.</p><p>"Alright, the competition is in two days. Keep a positive mindset, perform well. While it's almost impossible to defeat Mu Clan’s meticulously trained Yao Ang, this duel still presents an opportunity for you. Not every day can one gather so many important figures from Bocity to watch a young person's battle."</p><p>"Yes, even after entering the Magic University, a mage's advancement cannot do without resources. If a force sees potential in you and decides to sponsor you before university, it will greatly benefit your studies there. Competition among mages becomes fiercer at the university level; if you have nothing, you won't be able to compete against students from more powerful factions," Principal Zhu told Mo Fan.</p><p>The two teachers did not speak excessively; instead, they pragmatically informed Mo Fan of potential challenges ahead, hoping he would understand that a mage's growth path was not simple.</p><p>Mo Fan expressed his gratitude to the teachers once more.</p><p>……</p><p>……</p><p>Time passed quickly. The Mu Clan was now busily preparing in their estate.</p><p>As Mo Fan left the school, he looked up at a 45-degree angle, sighing. It had been three years already!</p><p>Before long, he would graduate from this school.</p><p>Three years ago, Mo Fan graduated from middle school. Three years later, he was about to graduate from this high school.</p><p>Today, countless cars were still parked at the school gate, most of them picking up their adorable magical children. The school had given students a ten-day self-study period in preparation for the magic college entrance exam scheduled for ten days later.</p><p>Before the magic college entrance exam, Mo Fan naturally faced another test.</p><p>In fact, he had been waiting for this day for a long time!!</p><p>He would never forget how Mu He's arrogant attitude three years ago had taken away their family home. His father, Mo Jiaying, had looked so humiliated that it made Mo Fan's heart ache even more.</p><p>He would also never forget how Mu Zhuoyun's disdainful demeanor two years ago had chased his whole family away like dogs, only to throw them a bone the next day and call him back. Was he destined to be at the bottom of society, dominated by these tyrants?</p><p>No one was born to be a slave unless they willingly licked their master's shoes!</p><p>Yesterday, he had been nothing but an insignificant fool and clown. Tomorrow, he would step into the Mu family's prestigious clan, relying on years of hard work to thoroughly defeat the disciples they had meticulously trained, showing those fools what it meant for a spark to ignite a prairie fire!</p><p>...</p><p>"Mo Fan, Mo Fan!" A familiar middle-aged man shouted at him.</p><p>"Dad, why are you here?" Mo Fan lowered his head from its 45-degree angle of looking up and said in surprise, "I heard the school gave us a self-study day off today. I came to pick you up."</p><p>Mo Jiaying showed a row of white teeth with a naive smile on his face. </p><p>It seemed like he had suddenly returned to three years ago when he had walked out of the failed exam hall. The same cars filled the school gate, and the same father, Mo Jiaying, was sweating profusely in the crowd waiting for him.</p><p>The difference was that Mo Jiaying had become much darker and thinner over these three years. It didn't take a genius to know he hadn't stopped working hard for the family.</p><p>The difference was that he had grown from a failed student who was nothing to a magician who mastered lightning and fire!</p><p>At least, he could justify Mo Jiaying's decision to send him to the magic school without hesitation back then!</p><p>"Dad, you don't need to work so hard. Didn't I transfer some money to you?" Mo Fan felt uncomfortable seeing how dark and exhausted Mo Jia Xing looked.</p><p>"Keep your money for yourself. A magician has many places where he needs money. I heard from those old mages at the station that there's something called a Stardust Magic Artifact that can speed up cultivation. I'll see if I can save up some money to buy one for you so you don't have nothing when you go to college and can't compete with kids from big cities," Mo Jia Xing said with a smile.</p><p>Mo Fan didn't know what to say at first.</p><p>Magic had replaced science, but Mo Jia Xing was still as simple and straightforward as any other father.</p><p>"It's okay. The school provides this kind of thing for me, so there's no need to worry. Use that money to take Auntie Xiao out to look for a place to stay when you have time. You don't even have to buy it; renting a room is fine," Mo Fan said.</p><p>This year, Mo Fan had hunted quite a few demons and earned a decent commission, around 120,000 or 130,000.</p><p>While this money couldn't buy magic tools or artifacts, it could allow his father to rest for a while and ease the economic pressure.</p><p>In fact, Mo Fan didn't know how to tell his father, Mo Jia Xing, that the Stardust Magic Artifact was actually extremely expensive, not something one could buy by working hard for a few years. No matter how many lifetimes he worked, he couldn't afford it.</p>
