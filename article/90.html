						<p>Moreover, the holy spring here played a significant role in helping to reach the level of an intermediate mage, and even by guarding it long-term, one could receive some nourishment through a door that was magically sealed. Otherwise, why would a distinguished intermediate mage be willing to stay underground?</p><p>"Head Guard Liang Wei, we have found the cave tunnel dug out by the giant-eyed rats. The tunnel seems very deep, so we dare not venture too far in," said a female guard dressed in a strikingly handsome guard uniform.</p><p>The female guard's beautiful eyes exuded a sense of bravery, and her white-fitted uniform added to her unique charm and allure!</p><p>"Deputy Head Guard Lin Yuxin, you are being overly cautious. Giant-eyed rats are common creatures within the city, and their digging into this place through the complex underground drainage system was merely an accident," added the new guard Wang Tonglian.</p><p>Lin Yuxin frowned, clearly disliking Wang Tonglian's carelessness.</p><p>"The Magic Association has already sent people to investigate and found nothing unusual. You can rest assured," said Head Guard Liang Wei with a smile.</p><p>Lin Yuxin simply nodded but did not seem to relax due to these words.</p><p>"I'll go outside and take a look," Lin Yuxin said before leaving with four guards.</p><p>The crowd couldn't help shaking their heads at the sight of Lin Yuxin's curvaceous figure retreating.</p><p>"Ever since her sister went missing, we rarely see Lin Yuxin smile. Ah, her sister's remains have yet to be found; such a good high school student just vanished without a trace," sighed Liang Bin.</p><p>"Haven't they said it was the giant-eyed rats that did it?"</p><p>"Perhaps, who knows."</p><p>...</p><p>After Deputy Head Guard Lin Yuxin left the chamber, she remained preoccupied with her thoughts.</p><p>A year after her sister's disappearance, she had been persistently searching for the giant-eyed rats and even entered their cave system beneath Bo City multiple times.</p><p>Despite the Magic Association sending investigators, Lin Yuxin refused to give up hope.</p><p>Without seeing the corpse, she was unwilling to believe that her most beloved sister had vanished from this world so abruptly.</p><p>Just yesterday, Lin Yuxin found something extremely unusual in the cave dug by the giant-eyed porcupine.</p><p>It was a puddle of water.</p><p>The presence of water in underground tunnels was quite normal; to others, there would be nothing surprising about it. However, to an aquatic mage, this was certainly not ordinary water—it was akin to the water from an Earth Holy Spring!</p><p>Why would water from an Earth Holy Spring appear in an underground passageway??</p><p>This was an extremely perplexing matter. The Earth Holy Spring’s water was protected so meticulously that even a drop was invaluable. Yet, within the underground tunnel she had inspected, this water was scattered like sewage in muddy ponds, left to be consumed by those foul rats and cockroaches.</p><p>With these doubts, Lin Yuxin specifically gave samples of the water to an alchemist specializing in material research from the Magic Association for analysis. The alchemist informed her that they would have answers today.</p><p>Lin Yuxin went to a deserted place. When she felt it was time, she called the alchemist from the Magic Association.</p><p>"How is it? Have you identified what it is?" Lin Yuxin asked.</p><p>"It’s not from an Earth Holy Spring," the alchemist said in a solemn voice.</p><p>"I agree with you." Lin Yuxin nodded. It seemed she had been overly cautious.</p><p>"However, apart from its effects being somewhat special, it is almost identical to an Earth Holy Spring in other respects," the alchemist explained.</p><p>"What do you mean? Is it possible to find another Earth Holy Spring in this world?" Lin Yuxin was thoroughly puzzled.</p><p>"The Earth Holy Spring is a Celestial Spirit Spring. Not only is it pure, but it also provides immense nourishment for cultivators and demons alike. The water similar to the Earth Holy Spring you found was likely born under special circumstances, possibly influenced by some dark plants nearby. Although this sewage-like water can temporarily boost the strength of cultivators and living beings, its difference lies in that it acts like a stimulant, causing organisms to become extremely frenzied at the cost of absorbing their nutrients and energy, ultimately losing all rationality," the alchemist said seriously.</p><p>Lin Yuxin was slightly stunned. She had never heard of such water before.</p><p>Could this be the reason why the normally timid and cowardly giant-eyed porcupine suddenly emerged to cause trouble??</p><p>"There is still one thing... I hope I am overthinking it." The pharmacist's tone suddenly turned serious.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"This sewage, if not consumed directly, can actually achieve a fake-for-real effect with the Holy Spring on the ground. At least within a day, it would be impossible to distinguish between the two," the pharmacist said.</p><p>Lin Yuxin felt an inexplicable chill run down her spine.</p><p>Fake for real??</p><p>This sewage inexplicably appeared in the cave dug by the giant-eyed squirrels, and exactly one year ago, there was almost a giant-eyed squirrel digging into the location of the Holy Spring. Was this coincidence??</p><p>"It might be coincidence," Lin Yuxin replied with a grim smile that she herself did not believe.</p><p>"I hope so... It's going to rain heavily soon. I'll pick you up from the Silver Trade Building, you probably didn't bring an umbrella." The pharmacist said.</p><p>"I am a water mage; do I need an umbrella?" Lin Yuxin asked.</p><p>"… Alright, shall we have dinner together tonight?"</p><p>"I have to guard the Holy Spring."</p><p>"… Alright."</p><p>Lin Yuxin hung up the phone with her brows furrowed, but her mind was filled with numerous doubts.</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>At the Snowpeak Mountain Station, a white-gray pickup truck jolted its way into the small village of Snowpeak Mountain.</p><p>Just as they entered the station, a sudden downpour erupted, descending swiftly and enveloping the entire mountain range in a continuous veil of rain. Orange mist appeared among the distant peaks.</p><p>"Almost lost this batch of goods; thank goodness I arrived on time." Mo Jiaxing jumped out of the vehicle, looking at the heavy rain outside with lingering fear.</p><p>"Why is this rain colored? It’s so strange," some of the old hunters in the station said.</p><p>"Hmm, it looks like urine color. Hahaha!" another hunter mage chuckled.</p><p>Mo Jiaxing walked past them, greeting a few acquaintances and smiling. Upon hearing that the rain was unusual, he glanced at the sky shrouded by the rain curtains.</p><p>Indeed, the rain seemed quite turbid.</p><p>The station remained as usual. Guarding the northern checkpoint was Wan Duandong, a direct subordinate of Zhankaung.</p><p>Wan Duandong was a thousand-man unit commander and an intermediate-level earth mage. When it came to defense, no one in this city could match him.</p><p>Dressed in a leather raincoat, he stood in the rain with an air of authority and solemnity.</p><p>His gaze fixed on the mountain forest drenched by the heavy rain, suddenly a bright light pierced through the orange-yellow rain, emitting a faint glow in the dim half-light.</p><p>"Radiance?" Wan Duandong widened his eyes, his expression darkening immediately.</p><p>Radiance was the initial skill of light mages and played a significant role among military mages for transmitting information and location.</p><p>Similar to primitive signal flares, demons had no perception of such lights. Staring directly at them could easily cause eye burns.</p><p>"Commander Thousand Men, that… that’s the alert signal. Why did Squad Three sound the alarm? Could there be demons infiltrating?"</p><p>A military mage beside him said.</p><p>As he spoke, another beam of Radiance tore through the distant rain curtains, this time more distinct.</p><p>At this moment, all the military mages stationed at the checkpoint froze.</p><p>Two beams of light!</p><p>Blue alert?</p>
