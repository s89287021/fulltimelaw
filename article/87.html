						<p>At this moment, Fat Shi, who was overweight but very sharp-eyed, kept staring at Mo Fan. After a brief hesitation, he finally spoke softly to his companions beside him, "Didn't you guys find it weird that this guy releases the Thunder Seal in a way that reminds you of someone?"</p><p>"You think so too!" Xu Dahang immediately glared at him.</p><p>Xiao Ke, who was munching on an apple, nodded vigorously beside them.</p><p>Li Wenjie's smile looked rather strange as he glanced at Guo Caitang.</p><p>Clearly, Guo Caitang had sensed something too; her pretty face was filled with an unwillingness to accept the reality.</p><p>"Fan Mo, Mo Fan, damn it, that's him!!" Xu Dahang suddenly realized something and shouted out.</p><p>The entire demon-hunting squad instantly understood. Their expressions could not be described in words.</p><p>They always knew that this guy Fan Mo was young, but they never imagined that he hadn't even graduated from high school.</p><p>Most importantly, apart from the Thunder element, he also possessed a powerful Fire element. His strength with Fire magic was actually no less than Xu Dahang's, their squad leader!</p><p>Guo Caitang had the most complicated feelings among them. In fact, during these past few months of living together, she had developed some affection for the mysterious Thunder mage, Fan Mo.</p><p>Everyone knew that Thunder mages had an unlimited future ahead; most Thunder mages would choose a comfortable job with high income and status. But young and ambitious Fan Mo had always stayed in their demon-hunting squad, performing exceptionally well and also staying calm under pressure. Furthermore, he once saved her life on his own and used the Thunder Seal to rescue the entire squad. It was natural for them to develop some fondness towards him.</p><p>In the end, these two guys, Fan Mo and Mo Fan, suddenly overlapped. The person who had a liking for him and the one with hatred and irritability came together; it really... it was unbelievable!</p><p>...</p><p>"Everyone, I have something to say," Principal Zhu spoke again.</p><p>Principal Zhu was highly respected, so everyone would naturally listen to him.</p><p>"A natural talent in two elements is an astonishing gift. With the magic college entrance exam approaching, our school intends to take advantage of this rare opportunity to make a big move and let people from other places see the might of Bocheng. Therefore, I hope that you guys can keep today's events under wraps for now, and wait until after the national magic college entrance exams to give Mo Fan, our city's outstanding mage, a truly nation-wide sensational moment," Principal Zhu's words echoed in everyone's ears.</p><p>Such a significant event, I estimate the media will be everywhere once we disperse.</p><p>The Magic College Entrance Exam is just around the corner, and Principal Zhu hopes to take advantage of this opportunity to really make a splash for Bocheng. Bocheng hasn't had such glory in a long time.</p><p>"I have no objections, but when we report upwards, we can delay it by at most two weeks," Yang Zuohé spoke on behalf of the Magic Association.</p><p>"Principal Zhu, with me here, who would dare to let that brat out early?" said Zhānkōng Lǎodà.</p><p>Zhānkōng was no fool. If news got out, larger organizations might come over to poach people; he, Zhānkōng, would be in tears. So, no matter what, they had to keep this under wraps.</p><p>Although so many people were present, it wasn't certain that everyone would keep quiet. But as long as they controlled the media and prevented them from spreading the news, let those chatty ones talk; anyway, they would only control until after the Magic College Entrance Exam when they would make their announcement.</p><p>"Speaking of which, is it really that exaggerated? Born with a dual affinity system, even the media needs to be blocked???" Wang Sanpang whispered.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue was among her students, and her heart had yet to calm down. Hearing Wang Sanpang's question, Tang Yue couldn't help but explain: "You guys in this small place of Bocheng naturally wouldn't know how astonishing a born dual affinity system is. Once the news spreads, Bocheng will be occupied by countless powerful forces the next day. Moreover, if Mo Fan chooses to join any force, some malicious ones might prefer destruction over preservation. After all, eliminating an initial-level mage like Mo Fan in secret would not be difficult for them. This embargo on information is good for both Mo Fan and everyone else."</p><p>"That can't be true, there are really that terrifying people? Wouldn't they be no different from the Black Inquisition?"</p><p>"People's hearts are evil; it's better to be cautious," Tang Yue said.</p><p>"Fangge has really caused a stir this time... Speaking of which, how did Fangge cultivate? Since he has dual affinities, shouldn't it take him more time? Why are both his systems so far ahead of ours."</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou couldn't help but say.</p><p>"Right, right!"</p><p>Xǔ Zhāotíng's mouth twitched even more. Zhang Xiaohou, can you keep quiet?</p><p>"Yuáng is probably going to cry until he turns into an idiot."</p><p>"That's right, haven't you seen that old rogue Mu Zhuoyún? He hates Mo Fan so much that he wishes he could adopt him as his son-in-law..."</p><p>"No, even the Chief Instructor wants to become sworn brothers with Mo Fan. With a high-level mage like the Chief Instructor supporting Mo Fan, who would dare touch him."</p><p>Ah, comparing oneself to others is truly soul-crushing.</p><p>While Mo Fan's classmates were discussing, Tang Yue had been staring at Mo Fan the entire time.</p><p>Now, Tang Yue finally knew how Mo Fan had killed the shadow wolf beast back then.</p><p>Speaking of which, this Mo Fan was truly astonishing; he kept his innate dual-element abilities hidden all along...</p><p>However, his actions could be considered clever. It's not bad to keep a low profile when one is not yet strong enough. With Zhan Kong, who has an immense passion for Mo Fan, supporting him from behind, Mo Fan's path of cultivation will become much smoother.</p><p>The only question is whether this fellow can make good use of his unparalleled innate dual-element abilities and stand out among the many prodigies in the country!</p><p>...</p><p>Tonight, Mo Fan naturally made a grand appearance!</p><p>With the Magic Association, Hunter Alliance, and Bocity Military Department jointly sealing off the news, it was unlikely for the information to spread within a short period.</p><p>Of course, the biggest draw of this magical duel is not just about regaining face from back then; more importantly, the winner will have the opportunity to cultivate in the Sacred Spring of Bocity for an entire week.</p><p>With the magic college entrance exam approaching soon, Mo Fan's cultivation will see significant improvement under the nourishment of the Sacred Spring of Bocity before the exam. Therefore, Mo Fan's performance in the magic college entrance exam is sure to impress the whole country!</p><p>At that time, he would truly gain fame far and wide, paving a very perfect path for his future magical journey.</p><p>"What exactly is this special place called the Sacred Spring?" Mo Fan couldn't help but feel extremely curious.</p><p>It is said that many mages who were stuck between the beginner and intermediate levels managed to break through with the help of this Sacred Spring. An intermediate-level mage is already quite impressive in Bocity!</p><p>Moreover, Mo Fan is a dual-element mage by birth. Once he reaches the intermediate level, he will possess three entire elements of magic, giving him an absolute advantage in the field of intermediate mages!</p><p>Alright, I must make good use of this rare opportunity to significantly enhance my strength!</p>
