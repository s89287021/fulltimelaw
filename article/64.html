						<p>Honestly, Mo Fan was puzzled by the reappearance of "shocks" apart from just showcasing his male heroism. The shock had already occurred once at Mingwen Girls' High School cafeteria. Why did such inexplicable tremors appear again not long after in another part of Bocheng? Were they caused by the giant-eyed shrews again?</p><p>It is said that after eliminating the giant-eyed shrew, other areas of Mingwen Girls' High School still experienced faint tremors. The police couldn't find a clear explanation, and the school confirmed that the campus was safe, thus proceeding with the scheduled opening.</p><p>"My grandma lives there. The area experiencing the tremor is over there," Zhou Min pointed to an old house and then to the ruins of the large construction site on the square. The construction team had left due to funding issues, making the entire ruinous district desolate. At night, the lights of the distant city couldn't illuminate it. Clouds obscured the night sky, and even the faint stars could not dispel the eerie atmosphere that permeated this ruined construction site.</p><p>Mo Fan, with his high skill level and boldness as a city manager, made a flexible jump over the temporary construction walls. Just as he landed gracefully, he found Zhou Min enter through a small door nearby, making the atmosphere incredibly awkward.</p><p>"Cough cough, when do these tremors usually start?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"At night, at unpredictable times," Zhou Min usually had a tough lady demeanor, but in this ruined construction site, she unconsciously moved closer to Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan took a few steps forward and pulled out something resembling an incense pouch from his pocket. When he opened the pouch, some sparkling powder appeared. Upon Mo Fan's breath, it immediately dispersed into the air and slowly settled over this construction site area.</p><p>"Yes," Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>Demon Detection Powder was essential for city managers when hunting demons in the dark and stormy nights!</p><p>"Why do you have such things? Do you really think there are demons here?" Zhou Min asked in surprise. Who would carry something like this, especially not in a bustling city like Bocheng!</p><p>"Lady, trust the professionals; take a look yourself," Mo Fan pointed to the already settled sparkling powder.</p><p>The powder scattered at a distance of about ten meters from the two people, forming an outline on the dusty ground as if it were clinging to something. This outline looked like... like a footprint!</p><p>Zhou Min was stunned.</p><p>Oh my God, are there really demons in this city of Bocheng??</p><p>Demons' scents are actually very hard for magicians to catch, especially those that have already left the area.</p><p>The special thing about demon-finding powder is its sensitivity to demons' scents. Even a footprint left by a demon ten days ago could immediately be adhered to by the powder!</p><p>"What... what should we do??" Zhou Min was scared pale.</p><p>She had always been a good student at school, firmly believing her teachers that the city was indeed the safest place. Who knew there would really be a demon's footprint? Demon-finding powder doesn't lie!</p><p>"I'll go take a look at the shape of the footprint..." Mo Fan wasn't afraid and went straight over.</p><p>"We... we should better notify the demon-hunting team," Zhou Min shivered involuntarily.</p><p>Mo Fan was speechless.</p><p>I am a real member of the Bocheng Demon-Hunting Team. Why would I need to report it?!</p><p>Moreover, the demon-hunting team isn't just sitting idly by; without sufficient evidence, they wouldn't easily mobilize the entire team.</p><p>The footprint outline left by the demon-finding powder can only be considered suspicious evidence, not conclusive proof. After all, there's always the possibility of a summoner walking their pet around this construction site.</p><p>"This footprint doesn't seem to belong to a giant-eyed hamster," Mo Fan frowned.</p><p>"M... Mo Fan... let's go," Zhou Min said fearfully.</p><p>Mo Fan was actually curious about what happened and continued walking into the construction site.</p><p>Zhou Min carefully followed Mo Fan.</p><p>"It seems to be hiding in that unfinished building," Mo Fan pointed to a building with only one floor slab ahead.</p><p>The building was supposed to be a shopping mall, and it had an extremely large floor area. Inside were piles of cement bags, tools, and waste materials. The traces shown by the monster hunters disappeared at this abandoned shopping mall building. If there was anything living inside, it must be hiding here, ruling with authority!</p><p>This construction site has been abandoned for at least two months, making it an ideal hiding spot.</p><p>"Mo... Mo Fan..." Zhou Min's voice suddenly became unbearably stiff, trying to warn Mo Fan in a strange way.</p><p>Mo Fan immediately followed Zhou Min's gaze and saw through the brick wall ahead. There was a black shadow writhing in what should have been the ground floor!!!</p><p>It was a creature with strong hind legs standing there, its head almost touching the second-floor ceiling.</p><p>Its overall shape resembled an evil wolf beast, but it differed in that it didn't walk on all fours like them; instead, it stood semi-upright like a werewolf!!</p><p>The biggest difference was its eyes.</p><p>There was only one eye on this huge wolf-like head, making it look exceptionally eerie in the night!</p><p>"It's... It's a cyclops wolf!" Zhou Min almost shouted out.</p><p>The cyclops wolf is a savage demon repeatedly mentioned by teachers in monster classes. Unlike creatures like giant-eyed rats that live in dark corners, cyclops wolves mainly inhabit remote mountains and forests. They have an inherent hostility towards humans and even enjoy eating them!</p><p>They relish killing, are greedy, and vicious, always keeping an eye on anyone who dares to leave the human habitation area!!</p><p>"Damn it, a cyclops wolf appearing so close to the city, who is going to manage this!!" Mo Fan was equally shocked by the scene.</p><p>Not long ago, he and Zhou Min both believed that cities were absolutely safe.</p><p>Who knew this would be the second demon they encountered in Bocheng.</p><p>Giant-eyed squirrels appearing in the city would not be strange, as these creatures often live in human cities' sewers and graveyards. However, how can we explain this vicious one-eyed demon wolf appearing here?</p><p>"What... what is it doing??" Zhou Min was already so frightened that her face had turned pale.</p><p>"It's having a midnight snack," Mo Fan answered.</p><p>Zhou Min looked closely and almost fainted.</p><p>The one-eyed demon wolf was chewing on something. In the dim light, Zhou Min saw a severed arm!</p><p>Heaven, that was a human arm.</p><p>How could this damn Mo Fan say so casually that the monster was having a midnight snack!</p><p>It was eating people!!!</p><p>It was really eating people!!!</p>
