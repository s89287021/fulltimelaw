						<p>"Go to hell!" Mo Fan roared, throwing the fire spout from his hand upwards.</p><p>A blinding ball of flame shot high into the air, instantly illuminating the dark cave and casting shadows of the fierce beasts and the Flame Youth below.</p><p>The Shadow Wolf Beast lifted its gaze, with a crimson, savage pupil flickering with confusion.</p><p>Is this human scared to death? Why is he throwing fire upwards!</p><p>The Shadow Wolf Beast was paralyzed by the Thunder Seal and could not move. In such a situation, it was too easy for Mo Fan's Fire Spout - Burn Bone to hit the Shadow Wolf Beast; it was like practicing on a humanoid wooden puppet...</p><p>However, Mo Fan made an action that even the Shadow Wolf Beast thought he was an idiot.</p><p>Mo Fan laughed, his mouth open wide, his maniacal smile illuminated by the firelight.</p><p>"BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The Fire Spout - Burn Bone soared upwards like a falling meteor and landed heavily on the base of a stalagmite.</p><p>The Burn Bone flame would not be helpless against rock; the internal combustion of the Burn Bone blaze could instantly scorch the thin, long root of the stalagmite.</p><p>"Giggle giggle giggle~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>In less than a second, the Burn Bone flame capable of turning bones to ashes severed the stalagmite!</p><p>The stalagmite was enormous. Once its root was broken, it immediately transformed into a giant stalagmite sword, hanging down from the highest point in the cave.</p><p>The Shadow Wolf Beast initially showed disdain and confusion; when it discovered that the severed stalagmite was above its head, it finally revealed a look of panic.</p><p>"Goodbye!"</p><p>He slowly retracted his hand that had thrown the fireball, and Mo Fan gave a cold laugh.</p><p>Yes, the Thunder Seal could only temporarily restrict your movement, and Burning Bone could not completely burn you to death, but I can crush you with my intelligence!</p><p>The stalactite was enormous, like a massive stone sword inserted into the body of the Shadow Wolf Beast...</p><p>It pierced straight through the back of the Shadow Wolf Beast, directly stabbing into its abdomen.</p><p>And it stuck there fiercely!</p><p>Blood gushed from the Shadow Wolf Beast's abdomen, sliding down the slightly cracked stalactite and quickly forming a conspicuous pool beneath it.</p><p>The Shadow Wolf Beast stood there...</p><p>It couldn't even fall down. Its crimson eyes gradually turned back to their original green as life drained away wildly.</p><p>It turned its head to look at the stalactite piercing through its body, then glanced at the tiny human figure.</p><p>Apart from disbelief, no other emotion could be seen in its eyes.</p><p>The pride and dignity of the wolf beast were completely gone. The increasingly weak creature's struggles had become futile.</p><p>Life continued to drain away without end.</p><p>By such a small magician...</p><p>......</p><p>......</p><p>"Huhuhuhuhu~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A gale howled as it swept through the mountain pass, lifting the heads of the battered students weakly. They saw an astonishing sight!</p><p>A man descended from above, his back adorned with majestic wings formed by wind spirits, capturing everyone's gaze.</p><p>"Wind… Wind Wings!!" Mu Bai, who had just regained consciousness, lifted her head in disbelief at the bearded man.</p><p>"It… It’s Headmaster!"</p><p>"Oh my God, what am I seeing? An angel?!!"</p><p>The mountain pass erupted in shock and awe.</p><p>They might have guessed that Headmaster Zhan Kong was an incredibly powerful mage, but they never imagined he would be a high-ranking mage who controlled Wind Wings!</p><p>Wind Wings!</p><p>That was the skill that allowed one to soar like an angel!!</p><p>Zhan Kong glanced at the students, momentarily safe from danger, then turned his gaze to the cavern that had just emitted a loud noise.</p><p>"I hope the student who released Fire Surge? Bone Burn is still alive." Zhan Kong did not dare linger. The full Wind Wings on his back flapped vigorously as he shot towards the cave like an arrow.</p><p>Zhan Kong skillfully maneuvered around the jagged rocks, and Headmaster Zhan Kong's magnificent and graceful passage through the long tunnel brought him to the spacious bottom of the cavern.</p><p>"Fire Surge? Explosion!"</p><p>Floating in the dark cavern, Zhan Kong summoned a Fire Surge effortlessly with a wave of his hand.</p><p>He hurled the ball of fire into the air, where it exploded like fireworks, instantly illuminating the entire cavern.</p><p>Zhan Kong's eyes searched. He only hoped that the Shadow Wolf Beast still retained some sense and would spare the student named Mo Fan’s life. As long as he was alive, Zhan Kong could fly back to the station and have a healer save this exceptionally talented student.</p><p>So, he did not hesitate to use his Stardust Mana, hoping to find the student as soon as possible.</p><p>The flame lit up the entire cave.</p><p>But in the next second, Zhan Kong froze.</p><p>The chief instructor stood there, his brown eyes filled with shock!</p><p>This… This is impossible!!!!</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>On the stone platform, Summoner Bai Yang sat nervously, praying that the big boss Zhan Kong would arrive in time.</p><p>"Someone's life is in danger, someone's life is in danger..." Chen Weiliang collapsed on the ground. If a student died during this training, he would be held responsible, as the country placed great importance on these magic students. Even Bocheng's local tyrant Mu Zhuoyun dared not harm the students.</p><p>Tang Yue bit her lip tightly.</p><p>Recalling that day when she had joked with the student named Mo Fan, saying she would use WeChat to locate and recover his body, she never thought this day would come so soon.</p><p>In fact, Tang Yue was really interested in Mo Fan. On one hand, she felt that the student seemed to be hiding secrets other than growing a Stardust Magic Tool; on the other hand, she believed that he had great potential and wanted to see how high he could reach...</p><p>What a pity, what a pity.</p><p>"Bai Yang, just what is going on? Why did your summoning beast suddenly go berserk? Even if Fen Gu made it suffer, there's no reason for it to become uncontrollable by you!" Luo Yunbo accused angrily.</p><p>As a summoner, the most basic requirement is to control one's summoning beast!</p><p>"I… I don't know either… Generally speaking, even if it gets killed, as long as I don't give an order to kill, it would never harm the students. I really have no idea why this happened," Bai Yang stuttered.</p><p>Everything really doesn't make sense.</p><p>Bai Yang never thought a student could release Fire Infusion? Burn Bone, truly injuring his summoning beast. He also didn't expect the summoning beast to go out of control as a result; there must be some other reason for this.</p><p>"You'd better pray that your out-of-control beast hasn't killed too many people," Pan Lijun said coldly.</p><p>"I… I… Ah!!" Bai Yang was about to explain when he suddenly felt an intense pain in his head.</p><p>This feeling was like his soul being brutally cut, causing Bai Yang's entire face to turn pale and beads of sweat to pour down his back!</p><p>"What's going on??" Luo Yunbo said impatiently.</p><p>"My… my Shadow Wolf Beast… my Shadow Wolf Beast!!" Suddenly, Bai Yang seemed to have lost all composure, collapsing to the ground with lifeless eyes staring at the cave.</p><p>"What's happening??" Tang Yue also frowned, not understanding what this summoner was up to.</p><p>"My Shadow Wolf Beast… it… it died!" Bai Yang said in a daze, his voice as if he didn't even believe himself.</p>
