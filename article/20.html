						<p>"Yes, today is a very important day for Tianlan High School. Coincidentally, Mu Ningxue returned from the Capital Academy on her summer break early. I discussed with the patriarch and invited her, as a flag bearer of Beicheng, to give a speech at Tianlan Magic High School and take a look at our annual assessment to evaluate the quality of this year's students," Mu He said.</p><p>Mu He looked at Mu Bai's energetic appearance and naturally knew what he was up to. He patted Mu Bai on the shoulder with a smile and said, "Don't worry, I will lead her to watch your performance. She will watch, as will the patriarch. If the patriarch sees how hard you are working, he might allocate more resources to your family. You know how many descendants we have in this clan, and how many excel like ants. Being favored by the patriarch and getting a couple of months with the Stardust Magic Artifact is beneficial for you!"</p><p>"Sta… Stardust Magic Artifact, really? Do I have a chance to get the Stardust Magic Artifact?"</p><p>Mu Bai's eyes lit up.</p><p>"That goes without saying. Do you think we are different from common mages because of superior genes or family upbringing? These things might be good, but they can't compare to the Stardust Magic Artifact! If you become a core disciple of the family, you will receive the Stardust Magic Artifact and your cultivation level will surpass all other students in school!" Mu He said.</p><p>"Uncle, I… I will definitely perform my best!"</p><p>Cultivation surpassing all other students in school!</p><p>Every mage's training time is limited. For apprentices like them, meditating for five hours a day was the limit, and the remaining time could only be used to learn theory and knowledge.</p><p>However, the Stardust Magic Artifact was what all mages longed for as a nourishing vessel.</p><p>Mu Bai did not know the principle of the Stardust Magic Artifact, but he knew that it could quickly restore energy to cultivators after they were exhausted from training, effectively shortening their fatigue time.</p><p>Generally, after five hours of meditation a day, the remaining 19 hours could only be used for other activities.</p><p>These 19 hours belonged to the meditation fatigue period and could only be passed by doing other things or simply sleeping.</p><p>For many students who wanted to progress further, this 19-hour fatigue period was too long and helpless. After concentrating intensely, a person would need a longer time to relax their nerves; otherwise, they might collapse mentally.</p><p>Shortening the meditation fatigue period meant extending daily meditation time!</p><p>One or two days might not show much effect, but one or two months would put them ahead of cultivators without the Stardust Magic Artifact. If it were three to four months or even longer, they would be leagues ahead of their peers!</p><p>The efficiency of meditation varies from person to person, some quick and others slow, but we won't delve into that for now. With this stardust magic artifact, even those with extremely low efficiency can lead the front pack. Those with talent and diligence will achieve twice the results with half the effort!</p><p>"Uncle, you mentioned earlier that students in the advanced class have a chance to be allocated stardust magic artifacts, is that true?" Mu Bai said excitedly.</p><p>"Yes, as it is a school, there are naturally some cultivation resources. However, the school's resources are very limited; if every student used one for a day, it would be equivalent to having none at all. Therefore, an annual assessment is necessary, and only students in the advanced class have the qualification to use stardust magic artifacts for a certain period of time. With your grades, getting into the advanced class should not be a problem. Then, I will make a small arrangement to allow you to hold onto the school's stardust magic artifact for a bit longer, which would benefit you greatly. After all, the school is a fair place, and I cannot do too much manipulation. The real leap for you will come from our Mu family's stardust magic artifact, something that common mages could never obtain in their entire lifetime. Therefore, you must cherish it well," Mu He said solemnly to Mu Bai.</p><p>"Don't worry, Uncle, I absolutely won't disappoint you."</p><p>"It's no use just telling me; you need to perform well in front of Mu Ningxue and the patriarch!" Mu He patted Mu Bai on the shoulder.</p><p>Mu Bai nodded firmly, a cold smile creeping onto his face: Xu Zaoting, what can you do when your cultivation is at par with mine? What difference does being able to control lightning make? Behind me stands the formidable Mu Family, there's no way you can ever compete with me!</p><p>"Oh right, how about that boy named Mo Fan?" Mu He remembered something casually, as if he was remembering a beggar he had reluctantly given money to on the street.</p><p>"He is a waste of space and will definitely be expelled from school," at this point, Mu Bai saw no need to hide his disdain for Mo Fan.</p><p>Mu Bai detested Mo Fan immensely.</p><p>Although everyone grew up in this area since they were young, Mo Fan was always surrounded by a crowd wherever he went, just like the Monkey King. What puzzled Mu Bai even more was that the illustrious Mu Ningxue also mingled with them and had a close relationship with them.</p><p>What did he think he was doing, running around the district and city like a wild monkey every day, exuding an air of insolence while revealing his lowliness in full view?</p><p>Did he understand what true power was? What identity meant? Did he know what it felt like to be poor and ridiculed for life?</p><p>The son of a servant was inherently vile and ignorant, with no concept of foresight or ambition. He enjoyed wallowing in the slums and stinking streets.</p><p>"Alright, I will report his resignation, I have already given an account to Mo Jiaxing's side. It's not that I haven't helped him; it truly is a foolish son who fails to become a mage even with an awakening opportunity. Sigh, many people just don't know when to stop; they waste money on futile attempts. The problem lies within your own worthless nature; do you really expect your son to rise above poverty? Poverty and incompetence are passed down through generations," Mu He said slowly while smoking.</p><p>At this moment, Mu He's half-closed eyes resembled those of an elegant old fox, exuding disdain and mockery towards such lowly creatures.</p>
