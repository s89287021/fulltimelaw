						<p>The entry and exit of the gate was clearly in the hands of a man named Zhan Kong. After the hundred top students got out of their cars, they all entered the Xuefeng Mountain Small Village.</p><p>The small village was simple, with just one main road. There were many shops and stalls along the main road, making it look no different from the market in a town.</p><p>However, what was sold here was not chickens, ducks, fish, or meat, but items needed by magicians for battles and cultivation.</p><p>"Come, come, high-quality demon shoes. Let me tell you, this is great stuff. Do you know which demon runs the fastest… That's right, it’s the Dashou demon. This is made from the skin of its hind legs, enchanted with a Wind Track rune, and powered by pure wind stones. When it runs… it will make the one-eyed wolf there stare in envy. If you want to buy this, I'll give it to you at a discount since you seem to have an affinity for this treasure."</p><p>"Erduzi, stop boasting. Is that thing even worth calling magic gear? A pair of Nike shoes would be more comfortable than yours."</p><p>"Bullshit! This is the skin from the hind legs of a Dashou demon we killed after sacrificing two people! It's genuine demon shoes!" Erduzi immediately got into an argument with the person mocking him.</p><p>Further down, there was another stall displaying colorful magic stones.</p><p>Magic stones were simple; they were special rocks born in places rich in elements like fire, wind, thunder, and earth. They contained energy similar to magical essence within a magician's star dust, although they couldn't be directly used by magicians, they could be embedded into various magic items and tools, providing an endless supply of power.</p><p>The teacher had mentioned these facts in class, and Mo Fan had paid close attention.</p><p>It was said that refined magic stones could sometimes serve as currency.</p><p>The consumption of magic stones was enormous, equivalent to energy sources in the scientific world.</p><p>Mo Fan initially thought that things like mobile phones, computers, and appliances should also be powered by electricity. Later, he learned that the power plants here did not use hydroelectric or wind power but relied on thunder-element magic stones.</p><p>He had no choice but to accept that Edison was the ancestor of light magic, as well as other facts like James Watt's invention of the steam engine leading to the Industrial Revolution… Yes, he was a fire magician. The principle of the steam engine was based on fire magic diagrams, using fire-element magic stones for power.</p><p>Therefore, this world did not have oil, hydropower, wind power, or electricity; what kept it going were these magic stones!</p><p>And where did these magic stones come from?</p><p>Certainly it is nature!</p><p>Ironically, demons also have a great need for magic stones. Magic stones serve not only as their primary food but are also a crucial source of energy for enhancing their power.</p><p>Therefore, the greatest obstacle humans face in collecting, searching for, and mining magic stones is not the harsh natural environment, but rather these same demons that rely on magic stones for survival.</p><p>Demons have an instinctive hostility towards humans.</p><p>Imagine this: how many magical technology devices there are in an entire city. These things are virtually a feast for demons, including humans themselves who are also their delicious prey. Thus, the conflict between human mages and demons has never ceased.</p><p>Perhaps, this is the greatest difference between the original world and the magical world.</p><p>In the original world, humans hold the dominant position, capable of sweeping away any place with a single missile.</p><p>However, in the magical world, there are no conventional weapons; only mages exist.</p><p>It may be precisely due to the inability to use conventional weapons that demons have come to dominate more territories.</p><p>Most humans can only live in cities, which require mage protection.</p><p>This is why the status of mages is always higher than that of ordinary people. It is not just because they wield powerful abilities but also because their mission is sacred!</p><p>...</p><p>"Fangge, we must perform well this time during our training; I heard that the evaluation scores will directly affect our college entrance exams. They account for 20% of the total score!" Zhang Xiaohou said to Mo Fan beside him.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>His class teacher, Xue Mucheng, had mentioned this earlier.</p><p>In fact, training is one subject in the "college entrance exam," as the scores are determined by the military, which acts as the overall instructor for this training.</p><p>The overall instructor's evaluation of C or A will directly determine whether the mage goes to a prestigious magic university or an ordinary one! </p><p>Like where Mu Ningxue is currently studying, the Imperial Capital Academy requires at least an A for admissions. </p><p>Mo Fan does not want to be content with just staying in the small city of Bocheng, and more advanced magic can only be learned in big cities and universities. </p><p>In this round of training, he also hopes to get a grade above an A so that he will have confidence in entering universities at the level of the Imperial Capital Academy! </p><p>"These instructors are all taken care of by the school, so even if you lounge around here for one or two months, you'll still receive at least a B or C. There's nothing to worry about," Wang Sanpang approached and said with a smile.</p><p>"That's right; it has always been like this in previous years," another student who knew the inside story nodded.</p><p>"You're right; the school definitely hopes that the instructors give higher scores."</p><p>"Meet at the square."</p><p>"Gather, gather!"</p><p>After Luo Yunbo shouted, all the students quickly gathered at the central square of Snow Peak Mountain Barracks.</p><p>The number wasn't small—there were 100 people in total, all wearing uniforms from Tianlan Magic High School.</p><p>"Look, the new batch of interns has arrived! Hahaha, we can watch these rookies make fools of themselves," said a man with a sharp mouse-like face.</p><p>"You're right; the station becomes the busiest during internship periods. How many do you think will wet their pants this year?" asked a burly-looking man who seemed to be the leader of a hunter squad as he poked his head forward.</p><p>"I guess at least 30!"</p><p>"Are the remaining 70 going to faint outright??"</p><p>The students lined up in the square, but they soon heard the murmur of the station veterans gathered around them. Most of them had malicious grins on their faces, openly mocking the students.</p><p>The 100 top-class students were divided into five groups, with each group consisting of 20 people. Standing at the front were the two instructors and one practical course teacher.</p><p>"Commandant!"</p><p>"Here comes the Commandant!!"</p><p>In no time, a well-disciplined team of uniformed magistrates walked in front of all the students. The aura emanating from them was one of authority.</p><p>Leading the group was none other than that same bearded man who had been playing with flames at the checkpoint - Zhan Kong.</p><p>Zhan Kong still looked leisurely, and it was somewhat unexpected for a Commandant to be so laid-back.</p>
