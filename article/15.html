						<p>Returning Ye Xinxia to her aunt's place and having dinner with them, Mo Fan was just about to continue practicing his lightning magic when he immediately felt a splitting headache. It felt like he had played League of Legends for three all-nighters in an internet cafe; his entire body felt like it was going to collapse!</p><p>What the hell is happening???</p><p>It felt like I'm mentally exhausted.</p><p>Is this ridiculous? Considering the incomplete release on the bus, I only used the Lightning Seal twice today, and my mana is already empty?</p><p>I thought that after five months of meditation, my Stardust would have accumulated enough magic energy. Who knew that releasing the Lightning Seal just twice made the entire lightning Stardust feel dim.</p><p>Mo Fan was initially startled, but as he relaxed and rested, there were signs of the lightning Stardust slowly recovering its glow, though very slowly!</p><p>"It seems that my Stardust is not yet radiant enough; each time I cast a spell, the Stardust's glow dims. When it completely fades, it means all the energy in the Stardust has been consumed."</p><p>Stardust stores magical energy.</p><p>No wonder Mr. Xue Musheng, our homeroom teacher, emphasizes all day long: even when things are monotonous, maintain your meditation; a magician with any talent will become ordinary without diligent meditation.</p><p>This sentence essentially means: no matter how skillful you are, if you run out of mana, you're still trash!</p><p>Forget it, I don't want to think about these things. I should get some sleep, otherwise, I really might collapse!</p><p>...</p><p>Nestled in the room, he slept soundly until dawn.</p><p>Ye Xinxia is also obedient; it’s almost noon, and she still hasn’t dared to wake me up.</p><p>Mo Fan got out of bed, feeling extremely shaky all over.</p><p>He skillfully entered the state of meditation, checked his star dust, and found that it had already brightened by a large margin. He believed he would soon be able to fully restore its usual brilliance.</p><p>"Oh right, my lightning element might not be good to expose in front of others. Although this is a ‘rule-based’ society, there’s no guarantee I won’t be envied; for example, the Mu Clan, which can control everything in Bog City. It seems I still need to cultivate my fire element, as it’s easier to cover up."</p><p>Mo Fan thought about this issue while brushing his teeth.</p><p>However, one has only so much energy in a day. How could he make sure that the lightning element ‘main wife’ would be satisfied and also win over the fire element ‘concubine’?</p><p>Mo Fan was able to develop his lightning element skills within five months because he devoted all his cultivation time to it. No matter how charming and mesmerizing the little demoness of the fire element was, Mo Fan remained single-minded.</p><p>There were about six more months until the annual magic assessment. If he didn’t want to reveal his lightning element powers too early, he would have to focus entirely on cultivating the fire element in the next semester and develop its basic skills.</p><p>But doing so meant that the growth of his lightning element star dust would be stalled for half a year.</p><p>Star dust wouldn’t grow stronger by itself if one did not meditate!</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Fan made some small plans for his upcoming meditation time.</p><p>Since the annual assessment was about six more months away, Mo Fan planned to allocate his daily 10-hour meditation time—what he could endure each day. He would spend 8 hours cultivating the fire element and 2 hours nurturing the lightning element.</p><p>This way, although the lightning element might grow very slowly, he could maintain a certain level of control proficiency.</p><p>Spending 8 hours learning the fire element daily was already a privilege for him compared to other students who could only meditate for 5 hours in total.</p><p>…</p><p>When lunchtime came, his aunt Mo Qing returned from work.</p><p>Cousin Qing is an ordinary woman, plain to the point of being unremarkable. She is very thin, has a sallow complexion, and is a kind person.</p><p>"Fan came over, I heard from your dad that you are diligently cultivating at Tianlan Magic High School. This time, make sure to work hard; if you can become an entry-level mage, it would be a great honor for our Mo family!" Qing said.</p><p>An entry-level mage being a great honor??</p><p>How many generations had we been poor!?</p><p>Sigh, I wonder if I count as one of them now!</p><p>"Where is Uncle? Why don't I see him?" Fan asked.</p><p>"He delivered supplies to the mountains for those hunters. I really can't understand it; he's just an ordinary person, where does he get the courage to go into the mountains? If he encounters a demon, they would probably devour him!" Qing complained.</p><p>"Isn't it true that demons usually reside in remote primeval forests far from our cities?" Fan said.</p><p>Different from the world I knew, many dangerous demons lived outside the cities in this magical world. Not only were ordinary people reluctant to venture into those places, but even mages often lost their lives there.</p><p>"That's not right; didn't you read the warning issued by the Hunter Alliance? Recently, demons have been rampant, and there have been frequent sightings of them beyond our city of Bocheng. They specifically warn us ordinary citizens to stay away from the Anjie Boundary," Qing said.</p><p>"It can't be that exaggerated, right?" Fan laughed.</p><p>Although Fan was new here, he had read many books. Demons were usually far from human cities, and renowned organizations such as the Magic Association, Hunter Alliance, and Grand Magic Clans regularly patrolled and cleared them to ensure the safety of city residents.</p><p>"You, you must have read yourself into a stupor. Think about it; which mayor wouldn't want their city to be peaceful and prosperous? Even if demons invade, they would likely claim that everything is under control to avoid panic... Actually, there have always been demons near our city, even within it; we just don't notice them as ordinary citizens," Qing said in a low voice.</p><p>Fan was stunned but managed to smile weakly: "Aunt Qing, you're really exaggerating."</p><p>"Alright, if you don't believe me. I'll tell you something true then, it's the truth; don't say that Auntie loves gossiping all day... You should know that I work in the logistics department of the hospital."</p><p>"Mm." Fan nodded.</p><p>Fortunately, Mo Qing didn't say he worked in which Holy Temple's treatment chamber; otherwise, Mo Fan would have another headache.</p><p>"One night, I went to deliver some external injury medicine to the chief doctor. Then, there seemed to be a healer in the operating room who gave our Dr. Wang a good dressing-down, saying: Even if you're just a healing apprentice, you shouldn't be so stupid as not to distinguish between swamp poison and water poison. Moreover, these people have been bewitched by evil spirits, which is why they look so dazed... Get out of here and stop causing trouble! Hurry up and find someone from the Hunter Alliance to locate that swamp demon with an evil eye, or even more people in this area will be affected!"</p><p>Mo Qing leaned over and said to Mo Fan in a very cautious tone.</p><p>Seeing Mo Qing's demeanor, Mo Fan didn't think he was making it up.</p><p>Could demons really be lurking near the city, or even inside it?</p><p>That would be terrifying. Demons were like man-eating monsters; encountering one meant certain death!</p>
