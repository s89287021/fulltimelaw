						<p>Zhang Xiaohou looked at Mo Fan with some surprise after hearing what he said. He had never considered these things before.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou himself was not sure whether what Mo Fan said was right or wrong; he just instinctively believed in Mo Fan's choices.</p><p>In fact, Zhang Xiaohou did not know that Mo Fan was quite experienced as a monster hunter and a hunter mage. Having grown up in such an environment, Mo Fan understood an important lesson: unity is strength. Why do hunters always form small teams when going out to hunt? Don't they know that more people are safer? In fact, the more people there are, the more likely they are to attract the attention of groups of demons and become easy prey for higher-level monsters.</p><p>The number of people in the vanguard team would not be too large. If they encountered a group of demons, they could simply avoid them and act more freely, making quick decisions to either flee or fight.</p><p>However, with a large force...</p><p>If they did not encounter a large group of demons, they might be safe. But once noticed by a warlord-level creature and its demonic horde, the entire large force would be wiped out, and their fate would no longer be in their hands.</p><p>...</p><p>There were ten people in the vanguard team, with Xue Musheng leading them.</p><p>After passing through the school gate, there were hardly any people to be seen on the streets.</p><p>Scattered city garbage, overturned stalls filled with broken goods, open shops left unattended...</p><p>When the crimson alert sounded, all citizens either hid indoors or frantically ran towards the safety barrier, creating chaos. This was also why the school staff did not evacuate immediately.</p><p>However, a significant number of people still had not reached the safety barrier. As Tianlan Magic High School started to relocate to the safety barrier, many nearby residents rushed over, hoping to rely on the students and teachers of Tianlan Magic High School to safely navigate through this terrifying district that stretched for three kilometers.</p><p>The vanguard team walked at the front of the group, and Zhang Xiaohou, who climbed to a higher spot, soon saw the masses gathering around the school...</p><p>"I'm afraid the number of people in this major relocation will exceed four thousand. There are many in this area who did not reach the safety barrier in time, too scared to go alone, now clustering like small metal shavings from different places into the large force," Zhang Xiaohou jumped down from an old staircase and said to everyone.</p><p>"Hmm, having more people might help avoid attacks from smaller groups of demons, but it will also make the entire large force cumbersome," Xue Musheng replied.</p><p>Magic High School is different from a Magic University. The students at a Magic University are stronger than a regular army, while those at Magic High School are all apprentice mages under eighteen years old. Under the crimson alert, protecting themselves is already impressive, let alone safeguarding civilians.</p><p>"That's something we can't do anything about; we can't just leave them behind," Zhou Min said.</p><p>"Let's go. Now that the main force has been reduced to four thousand people, our burden is heavier," Xue Mucheng said.</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou and Zhang Luying, the two wind mage scouts, led the way, with the rest of the personnel following closely behind.</p><p>Xue Mucheng was clearly a former military instructor, experienced in manpower allocation and maintaining formation, so he wasn't completely at a loss in such situations.</p><p>The group moved fairly quickly, marching straight through the main street by the school gate, then passing through a pedestrian street and an elevator block residential area to reach the safety barrier.</p><p>The main street was one kilometer long, completely blocked by abandoned vehicles. Not only were buses unable to pass, but even bicycles would find it difficult to navigate smoothly.</p><p>Transportation was essentially paralyzed, leaving walking as the only option. Three kilometers wasn't very far, yet no one could predict what would happen.</p><p>"There's a giant-eyed rat at the newspaper kiosk ahead," Zhang Yinglu ran back with a pale face, panting slightly as he spoke to everyone.</p><p>"It was chewing on a child," Zhang Xiaohou added.</p><p>When they saw it, the child was already dead. The sight of such a gruesome scene was shocking and heartbreaking.</p><p>Continuing forward, after avoiding a large bus blocking the street, they could immediately see the blood-stained newspaper kiosk and the ten-year-old boy lying in a pool of blood.</p><p>"Where's the giant-eyed rat?" Xue Mucheng frowned, searching but not seeing the creature they described.</p><p>"It was clearly there just now..."</p><p>"GRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!"</p><p>Just as Zhang Yinglu was about to speak, a figure full of bristles suddenly appeared from behind a Volkswagen. Two large fangs lunged at the unprepared Zhang Yinglu.</p><p>"Chortle~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Zhang Luying appeared to be a frail girl, but her neck was bitten by the giant-eyed squirrel in front of everyone's horrified eyes. Fresh blood spurted out and splattered all over the big bus that still had advertisements on it.</p><p>This scene happened too suddenly!</p><p>Even Teacher Xue Museng was completely unprepared; he was right next to Zhang Yinglu, and the blood from her neck splashed onto his face.</p><p>"Get into the bus quickly!" Mo Fan shouted at everyone as the shocking moment unfolded.</p><p>Everyone snapped out of their daze and stumbled towards the big bus.</p><p>Xue Museng's reaction was relatively quick. He pulled Zhang Xiaohou into the bus, while that terrifying giant-eyed squirrel, due to its size, crashed into the bus door just as it was about to continue killing.</p><p>The others also became somewhat panicked and hid in the bus as well.</p><p>Seeing Zhang Yinglu killed right before his eyes, Xu Zhaoting, who was furious, began calling upon the power of lightning elements.</p><p>Mo Fan originally planned to link to star orbits, but the scattered Demon-Hunting Powder drifted off in different directions. This suddenly made Mo Fan realize something!</p><p>"Everyone, get onto the bus quickly! There's more than one giant-eyed squirrel here!" Mo Fan shouted.</p><p>After saying that, Mo Fan grabbed Zhou Min, who was watching him cast magic, and pulled her towards the big bus.</p><p>"Monkey, forget about Zhang Yinglu. She's already dead. Quickly distract that giant-eyed squirrel or we'll all die here!!" Mo Fan shouted at Zhang Xiaohou as they ran.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou was relatively calm. When the giant-eyed squirrel launched its attack, he had already activated Wind Orbit. Zhang Xiaohou still simply wanted to save Zhang Yinglu, but unfortunately, he didn't know that under such a surprise attack by demons, very few novice mages could survive.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou's eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>In just the blink of an eye, a girl who had been his classmate for two years was dead. Damn demon, damn demon!!</p>
