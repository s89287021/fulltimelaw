						<p>Mou Fan… Mou Fan… What should we do, we can’t run away anymore.” Zhou Min was scared white as she hid behind Mou Fan.</p><p>This was an old district that was deserted at night due to the construction site nearby. The lone-eyed werewolf had already burst out of the site and was charging down the still muddy street straight towards them. Under the shade of a cluster of old banyan trees, all one could see was a dark shadow sweeping by.</p><p>“Hurry up and take your grandma away, I’ll hold this thing off!” Mou Fan said to Zhou Min.</p><p>No matter how fast they ran, they couldn’t outrun the lone-eyed werewolf charging on all fours. At this moment, Mou Fan realized again just how important having a teleportation skill was.</p><p>“How are you going to…?” Zhou Min’s voice trembled as she spoke.</p><p>“Stop wasting time.” Mou Fan shouted at her.</p><p>Although Zhou Min was also a Fire Mage, her Flame Scorching spell had no effect on such a large lone-eyed werewolf. The signal device indicated that one of their monster-hunting teammates was nearby and should be able to provide support.</p><p>Zhou Min finally stopped stammering and hurried into the houses in the old district.</p><p>However, Mou Fan underestimated this silly girl’s kindness; she not only alerted her grandma but also tried to save the elderly people still living in the old district.</p><p>When Mou Fan realized that there were still many elders residing in the old district, he frowned.</p><p>Had it not been for uncovering this thing today, these elders would probably have become food for this lone-eyed werewolf.</p><p>Here comes!</p><p>Finally, the lone-eyed werewolf charged over. It was only 20 meters away from Mou Fan.</p><p>In those 20 meters, the lone-eyed werewolf could probably cross in less than a second.</p><p>It had to be said that demons were much more terrifying than what schools described. This lone-eyed werewolf charging over gave one a mental pressure no different from a car flying towards them. An ordinary person would just freeze on the spot.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you to stop chasing? You fucking still chase, do you think my body will drop epic equipment?!” Mou Fan stared at this flying lone-eyed werewolf and raged.</p><p>Mā guī mà, Mo Fan did not submit to defeat.</p><p>Intent focused on the scythe-shaped seal in the spiritual world, a soul light suddenly burst forth from Mo Fan’s body.</p><p>Before Mo Fan’s eyes, the light rapidly traced out a three-dimensional rhombic shield that towered slightly above human height.</p><p>At the peak of the light’s intensity, a green-black bone shield with distinct edges materialized in front of Mo Fan.</p><p>A magical artifact, Scythe Bone Shield!</p><p>The massive one-eyed demon wolf had no idea that a Scythe Bone Shield would appear. It was unable to brake in time as it tried to ram Mo Fan into paste...</p><p>"Bang!!!!!!!"</p><p>Due to its hunched posture, the one-eyed demon wolf hit its head on the bone scythe shield, which gave off a violent tremor. First, it sent the heavily impacted one-eyed demon wolf flying over ten meters away, and then it also launched Mo Fan who was protected under the shield.</p><p>After the Scythe Bone Shield blocked the one-eyed demon wolf’s fierce collision, it immediately turned into fragments of light and disappeared in thin air, while Mo Fan skidded down the cement street as if wearing roller skates.</p><p>Mo Fan felt a dull pain in his chest.</p><p>He immediately experienced nausea. Although the Scythe Bone Shield had absorbed the strongest impact from the one-eyed demon wolf, Mo Fan still felt like something had fiercely collided with his chest.</p><p>"What a powerful beast!!"</p><p>Mo Fan was secretly alarmed.</p><p>The quality of the bone scythe shield was quite good; it could easily withstand a full-force attack from a demonic monster without any damage. However, this one-eyed demon wolf’s collision still left Mo Fan feeling its impact, indicating that if it hit his body directly, all his bones would shatter!</p><p>The one-eyed demon wolf crashed onto the street, and blood gushed out of its head.</p><p>It shook its head and got up, like a person using one paw to support its disoriented wolf head.</p><p>"Can it even stand up? Is its body made of iron?" Mo Fan saw that the One-Eyed Devil Wolf had not lost its mobility at all; its chin was almost touching the ground.</p><p>Was it because the demons he had seen before were too weak, or was this One-Eyed Devil Wolf particularly strong? If it were the previous Shadow Wolves and Giant-Eye Rats colliding with him, his bones would have shattered!</p><p>Run! Run quickly!</p><p>Taking advantage of this wobbly state, he ran as fast as he could.</p><p>Running alone wasn't enough; it could catch up to him soon. He needed to use a Thunder Seal now to disable it for a moment!</p><p>At this point, Mo Fan dared not hide his strength anymore. If Zhou Min saw his lightning abilities, so be it. Keeping this girl from talking about it wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to ease the pain in his chest, Mo Fan prepared to control his lightning star track.</p><p>"Ice Vine? Condense!"</p><p>Just as Mo Fan controlled two lightning stars, a woman's delicate cry sounded from not far away.</p><p>A cold chill instantly filled this old street, and frost started to fall from the air without any warning...</p><p>The falling frost formed instructions, quickly gathering beneath the One-Eyed Devil Wolf's feet, freezing the ground around it into ice.</p><p>These frost particles spread; they climbed up the One-Eyed Devil Wolf's powerful legs. In just a few seconds, its lower limbs were frozen solid like icicles.</p><p>If the One-Eyed Devil Wolf had been in high-speed mode, Ice Vine might not have been able to freeze it immediately. However, since the wolf was still disoriented, by the time it came to its senses, its legs were completely frozen, making every step extremely difficult!</p><p>Mo Fan was delighted. Turning around, he saw Ling Bing, a woman wearing black-purple jeans that accentuated her long legs, standing at the entrance of the street. The white ice star track still emitted some light around her body, highlighting this ice mage's beauty.</p><p>"Caitang!!" Mo Fan was overjoyed.</p><p>Not forgetting that she had once saved his life with a Thunder Seal, her timely intervention this time around protected her prized Thunder-type creature. </p><p>"Little brat, how did you end up here?" Guo Caitang looked at Mo Fan with some surprise.</p><p>Guo Caitang couldn't possibly forget this guy; he had brought a bunch of little kids to secretly watch her bathe, and she would never forget it in her lifetime, hating him intensely. </p><p>"I... I was meeting up with my classmate here for a rendezvous. Luckily you showed up," Mo Fan immediately retreated to a distance and reunited with Zhou Min and her grandmother.</p><p>"Get lost quickly; our monster-hunting team is already nearby," Guo Caitang said without any patience.</p>
