						<p>Three groups of twenty people had just crossed the valley and were in a forest at the foot of a cliff. A man wearing a hat jumped down from a tree, still holding a scoreboard! After registering, he quickly left the forest and headed towards an open grassy field.</p><p>"Group Three has all passed; Zhang Xiaohou, the wind-element student, performed exceptionally well," said the man in the hat as he entered a tent and addressed another man inside.</p><p>If the students were here, they would undoubtedly be surprised to see that their practical lesson teacher and most of the instructors were present. Each was comfortably seated on the grass, munching snacks and sipping light drinks.</p><p>"Oh?" Chief Instructor Zhan Kong raised his eyebrows skeptically.</p><p>In Zhan Kong’s memory, there didn’t seem to be a Zhang Xiaohou among the higher-ranking wind-element students.</p><p>Sigh, that makes sense; cultivation is just a foundation. The truly independent mages rely on their brains and courage!</p><p>"Make note of the name and give him a high score," Chief Instructor Zhan Kong said to his deputy instructor, Pan Li jun.</p><p>Pan Li jun nodded and promptly wrote down Zhang Xiaohou’s name.</p><p>"Haha, it seems only the station soldiers know how to have fun." Zhang Jianguo laughed heartily.</p><p>"That’s right. First, we throw these students directly into a big mountain, clearly indicating that there will be no rescue or assistance. Then we secretly follow them and mark those who perform outstandingly during the task... This method is flawless!" Chen Weiliang also chuckled.</p><p>"Yes, compared to idling away time before, this certainly better demonstrates each student’s mental fortitude," Teacher Tang Yue agreed.</p><p>If those hundred students were to learn that their teachers and instructors had collaborated to deceive them, one wonders what expressions would cross their faces.</p><p>Of course, the teachers and instructors could not abandon these students. With what they were currently learning, the students did not yet have sufficient ability to survive in the wild. However, without creating the most realistic environment, the effect would be unsatisfactory. Thus, the best approach was to appear harsh on the surface while secretly following them; if any major mishap occurred, they could immediately intervene.</p><p>"Boss Zhan Kong, I almost got fooled by you. I thought you were really going to be that ruthless, not letting a single student pass this trial," Deputy Instructor Pan Li Jun said.</p><p>"This is where you're wrong; those who have no effect in the trial won't be allowed to pass," Zhan Kong said directly.</p><p>"T-this... but this reward is impossible for anyone to complete."</p><p>"Yes, I think being able to get through that demon vine area is already incredibly impressive," Chen Wei Liang said.</p><p>"The true reward is of course impossible for them to complete; let alone them, the instructors here might not be able to complete it either," Zhan Kong said with a laugh.</p><p>"Instructors can't even complete it?? What do you mean??" Zhang Jian Guo asked in confusion.</p><p>"It's like this: since we've set the one-eyed demon wolf den as the destination for students' trials, we need to ensure that there are no remaining one-eyed demon wolves inside. Therefore, we also sent a summoner mage to guard it. That summoner mage is actually the final test for all the students. There really are no demons in the den, but there is a summoned creature..."</p><p> Luo Yun Bo said with a laugh.</p><p>The teachers' eyes lit up upon hearing this.</p><p>As the Director of Instruction, Chen Wei Liang clapped his hands and cheered!</p><p>"Brilliant, too brilliant, this move is truly genius!!"</p><p>Xue Mu Sheng nodded vigorously and said, "Yes, we certainly can't let these students face real demons now; it would result in heavy casualties. But trials are meant to train each student's composure when facing demons. Not facing demons wouldn't achieve the purpose of the trial. Sending a summoner mage there and letting his summoned creature act as a demon is perfectly suitable, achieving the effect of making students realize what real demons are like while also ensuring their safety!"</p><p>"I'm truly grateful to Boss Zhan Kong for coming up with such a perfect training method. I believe that this trial will definitely yield great results for the students!" Xue Mu Sheng said with a smile.</p><p>"That's what should be expected."</p><p>"Speaking of which, there should only be one summoned creature. What if those students are fiercer than we imagined and team up to defeat that summoned creature?" Teacher Tang Yue couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Sigh~ Teacher Tang Yue, you're overthinking it... We've been teaching at Tian Lan Magic High School for twenty years and have never heard of any students being able to fully cast a spell the first time they face demons. Even if one of them could fully cast a spell, given that these students only know Level 1 skills, they would be unable to injure the summoned creature's bones," Zhang Jian Guo said with confidence.</p><p>"Yes, among all elemental spells, fire and lightning are the most powerful. Only Lightning Xu Zhao Ting can slightly intimidate the summoned creature, and Fire Zhi Shao Rou can at best cause some skin damage to it," Chen Wei Liang said with a chuckle.</p><p>The teachers and instructors all burst into laughter.</p><p>Indeed, they were well aware of the students' capabilities; this mission itself was an impossible task. What they wanted was for the students to grow through the process. As for everything that would happen during the mission, they basically had a good grasp of it!</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue did not laugh; she glanced at the valley shrouded in mist in the distance.</p><p>"Mofan has held onto the Stardust Artifact for a whole year; I wonder if his Fire Infusion has improved to a higher level. If that's the case, he should be the only student capable of injuring the summon beast. Getting an S for injuring the summon beast shouldn't be a problem," Teacher Tang Yue muttered to herself.</p><p>Then, Tang Yue shook her head.</p><p>Facing fierce demons, being able to release a skill in full was already quite impressive.</p><p>Tang Yue only hoped that the hundred top students would not suffer a total defeat at the summon beast stage. Because if any of them released even one skill at this stage, Zhan Kong would give their training course an A grade!</p><p>An A was the highest grade students had received from instructors over all these years of training!</p>
