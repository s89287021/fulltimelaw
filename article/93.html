						<p>"How do I get there? This is a secret room," Mo Fan said speechlessly, looking at the drenched female guard.</p><p>"Follow me and you’ll be fine." Lin Yuxin didn’t waste time on words with Mo Fan; she quickly walked to the altar.</p><p>Not knowing which button she pressed, the sacred spring water that was circulating suddenly flowed into some small holes.</p><p>"Gurgle~~~ gurgle~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Within seconds, all the sacred spring water disappeared, leaving no trace in the little stone ditch.</p><p>Lin Yuxin then briskly walked to the top of the altar and pulled off the still warm leather cushion Mo Fan had been sitting on.</p><p>The board underneath the cushion could be opened; after Lin Yuxin lifted it, she found a blue bottle inside. It seemed that the bottle contained the exceptionally clear sacred spring water.</p><p>Mo Fan felt somewhat curious. How could so much sacred spring water fit into such a small bottle, about the size of a can of cola?</p><p>Lin Yuxin carefully put away the bottle containing all the sacred spring water and turned to look at this student who looked slightly simpleminded and was preparing for his magic college entrance exam. "This is the emergency protection plan for the sacred spring water. There is another passage in the secret room, which should lead to the back of your Tianlan Magic High School."</p><p>"To the school’s back? Miss, could you please tell me what happened first," Mo Fan said anxiously.</p><p>"You’ll know when we get out. Follow me first; their target is the sacred spring water. We must not let it fall into those people’s hands." Lin Yuxin didn’t want to explain too much.</p><p>"Those people?" Mo Fan was even more confused, having no idea what Lin Yuxin meant.</p><p>Lin Yuxin walked over to the wall, and her fingers pressed on what seemed like an ordinary stone wall as if entering a password.</p><p>Mo Fan watched in amazement. So engrossed in his training here, he hadn’t realized that there were so many mechanisms in this sacred spring water secret room.</p><p>"Chang~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A sound echoed, and the restrictive stone wall beside them suddenly opened up, revealing a dark passage, leading who knows where.</p><p>"Leave here quickly." Lin Yuxin, without another word, grabbed Mo Fan and headed into the dark passageway.</p><p>Mo Fan also realized that something big must be happening outside and dared not hesitate too long.</p><p>After taking just a few steps inside, Lin Yuxin suddenly remembered something. Those sharp eyes of hers fixed on Mo Fan.</p><p>"This secret passage may not be safe. The people from the Black Vatican will likely target me. You must keep this sacred spring safe." Lin Yuxin seemed to have made a decision that even she found rather rash.</p><p>However, Lin Yuxin had no choice but to do so.</p><p>The Black Vatican was fully prepared and knew nearly everything about the sacred spring. If they encountered anyone from the Black Vatican during their escape, their primary target would definitely be her, the deputy warden, while Mo Fan, as a student, might be overlooked by them.</p><p>As long as they could preserve the sacred spring, there would still be hope!</p><p>"Please tell me what happened first!" Mo Fan was also becoming quite impatient.</p><p>From Lin Yuxin’s dazed appearance, it was clear that something huge had happened in Bo City.</p><p>"Red Alert!" Lin Yuxin couldn’t explain this to the student right away, as he had been sealed in the dungeon for a while and knew nothing about what was happening outside.</p><p>Red Alert??</p><p>A boulder suddenly smashed into Mo Fan’s heart, stirring up immense waves!!</p><p>After arriving in this world, Mo Fan learned an important piece of information: humans were not the absolute rulers in this magical society. Outside the cities lived demons numbering hundreds or even thousands of times more than humans!</p><p>Therefore, the highest magic associations in the five continents referred to this kind of threat from demon invasions as alerts, categorizing them based on the number and strength of the demons.</p><p>Just like how warnings are issued during natural disasters in scientific societies, different levels were assigned to these human calamities caused by demon invasions!</p><p>"Leave here quickly." Lin Yuxin grabbed Mo Fan without hesitation and led him into the dark passageway.</p><p>Mo Fan realized that something significant must be happening outside and did not dare to hesitate.</p><p>After taking only a few steps inside, Lin Yuxin suddenly remembered something. Her sharp eyes focused on Mo Fan.</p><p>"This secret passage may not be safe. The Black Vatican will likely target me. You must keep this sacred spring safe."

Mo Fan was becoming increasingly impatient.</p><p>From Lin Yuxin’s dazed appearance, it was clear that something huge had occurred in Bo City.</p><p>"Red Alert!" Lin Yuxin couldn’t explain this to the student right away, as he had been sealed in the dungeon and knew nothing about the outside world.</p><p>Red Alert??</p><p>A boulder suddenly slammed into Mo Fan’s heart, stirring up immense waves!!</p><p>After arriving in this world, Mo Fan learned an important piece of information: humans were not the absolute rulers in this magical society. Outside the cities lived demons numbering hundreds or even thousands of times more than humans!</p><p>The demons constantly watched human resources and would launch massive attacks on human cities like armies at the command of certain demon leaders, akin to kings. There were cases where weak resistance cities vanished overnight!</p><p>Therefore, the highest magic associations in the five continents referred to this kind of threat from demon invasions as alerts, categorizing them based on the number and strength of the demons.</p><p>Just like how warnings are issued during natural disasters in scientific societies, different levels were assigned to these human calamities caused by demon invasions!</p><p>"Leave here quickly," Lin Yuxin grabbed Mo Fan without a word and led him into the dark passageway.</p><p>Mo Fan realized that something crucial must be happening outside and did not dare to hesitate.</p><p>After taking just a few steps inside, Lin Yuxin suddenly remembered something.

This is Level One Alert, meaning that demons have appeared near the border of this city, with a number exceeding three hundred!</p><p>An Orange Alert occurred two years ago, causing widespread panic at the time.</p><p>A Blue Alert is even more terrifying; for Bocheng, it means a bloodbath. Who knows how many magicians and civilians will lose their lives in the demons' fierce invasion?</p><p>And the next level up, Red Alert...</p><p>That is a cataclysm, a massacre, a disaster for the city. The limited number of military mages cannot completely resist the demons' invasion. The demons will storm into the city, slaughtering mercilessly. It's not just a few stray demons; it's hundreds or even thousands!</p><p>Many magicians are already being butchered like poultry when facing a single demon, let alone ordinary people who have no strength to defend themselves??</p><p>In a Red Alert, the city will be awash with blood, and corpses will litter the ground!</p><p>According to descriptions in books, this is already terrifying. But what kind of hell will it be when all of this happens right before our eyes??</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan and Lin Yuxin, still somewhat disbelieving, emerged from a secret tunnel on the north side of a mountain in the city.</p><p>The rain was still pouring down, shrouding Bocheng in an oppressive atmosphere as dark clouds loomed overhead. Distant roars that made hearts race pierced their ears, causing them to tremble all over.</p><p>Mo Fan looked towards the source of the demonic growls...</p><p>Oh my God, it's a residential area!</p><p>Flattened buildings, some old cement streets... a market place flowing with red blood!</p><p>That blood could not possibly be from poultry; it was human blood, forming small streams that kept pouring into low-lying areas and drains under the rain's deluge!</p><p>Bright crimson, strikingly bright crimson.</p><p>Standing atop the mountains behind this city, the grayish-bluish Bocheng that was usually shrouded in rain now bore streaks of blood everywhere.</p><p>Bocheng is a city with distinct southern Chinese charm, resembling a beautiful scroll painting when it rains. However, Mo Fan saw this scroll covered in bloodstains today, and a nightmare descended!!!!</p><p>"Ahh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A trembling roar suddenly echoed across Bocheng, causing goosebumps to run down one's spine.</p><p>Mo Fan abruptly turned his head and looked towards the source of the sound, only to be met with an awe-inspiring sight!!!</p><p>A grayish sky enveloped the city, with Bocheng's iconic building, the Silver Trade Tower, standing out prominently as if reaching nearly to touch the gray heavens. However, at the very top of this towering structure, a huge shadow was perched there!!!</p><p>Its tail hung down from the dome of the Silver Trade Tower, almost halfway!</p><p>One half of its fleshly wings were partially obscured by the rain, while the other half blocked out several floors of skyscrapers!</p><p>Its head was raised high, and that roar powerful enough to shake the entire city emerged from its blood-red maw capable of swallowing clouds and exhaling mist!</p>
