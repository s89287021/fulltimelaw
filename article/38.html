						<p>The bus journey took us through a vast expanse of wilderness outside the city, and soon we could see one mountain after another coming into view. The forests were lush and deep; up close, they were dense with foliage and weeds, while in the distance, the peaks rose jaggedly and the clouds were thick. "Do you see that solitary mountain over there? That's Mount Snowpeak. It marks the border of our Bocheng City. The Snowpeak Station is located in the valley between Mount Snowpeak and Thunderstorm Mountain," Luo Yunbo began to introduce to the students.</p><p>"Our Bocheng is a city of moderate size. If it were one of the megacities like Megacity, Imperial Capital, or Demon Capital, their border points wouldn't be called stations or small camps," said Instructor Pan Li jun, whose hair was only as long as an index finger.</p><p>"By the way, since you frequently deal with demons and monsters, you must all be middle-rank mages?" Wang Sanpang asked.</p><p>"Middle-rank?" Pan Li jun glanced at Wang Sanpang and replied coldly, "How could a middle-rank mage possibly lead this bunch of brats."</p><p>Wang Sanpang was not pleased by her remark either. He muttered, "So you're all just beginners with nothing to brag about."</p><p>Wang Sanpang had the habit of speaking his mind, but the two instructors looked at each other and smiled, clearly finding his words childish.</p><p>The bus continued its journey into the mountains, and they rode for a large part of the day. During this time, Mou Fan did not rest. He maintained his meditation in the back of the bus. He had a special connection with buses; the last completion of the seven stars of the Thunder Seal had taken place on one.</p><p>This time, Mou Fan felt as though his Fire Magic was touching something. The Little Mud Loach Pendant functioned like a stardust magic artifact, significantly increasing his cultivation time. It had been a year since his annual assessment, and during this time, apart from the overall brilliance and expansion of the stardust, he noticed some noticeable changes in the star dust within his Fire Magic. What used to flicker on and off was now a steady glow.</p><p>It is said that once a star exhibits a noticeable transformation in its radiance, the amount of magical energy it can convey will become much larger, and the effects and power of its skills will also be enhanced!</p><p>I spent an entire sophomore year improving this.</p><p>I wonder what kind of power an even more advanced Fire Surge will have; I am really looking forward to it!</p><p>...</p><p>The Snowpeak Mountain Station was finally reached.</p><p>Although called a small village, it is far from being a simple and shabby village.</p><p>Both sides of the station are supported by incredibly steep cliffs, each reaching heights of over a hundred meters, making one look up completely to see the sky.</p><p>These cliffs form a natural barrier on both sides, and the valley path in front and back is locked by two massive stone gates, turning the entire station into a fortress town embedded within the valley.</p><p>"This is the Snowpeak Mountain Small Village. It is said that except for flying demons or high-level demons with strong climbing abilities, this fortress town can keep almost all malevolent creatures out of Anjie territory. Ever since we had the Snowpeak Mountain Station, we haven't heard any reports of demon attacks within Anjie for several years," Zhang Jianguo stepped off the bus and couldn't help but marvel at the massive guardian stone gate.</p><p>"Teacher, I heard that this guardian stone gate was built by our famous earth mage and architect in Bocheng, Zhang Yuheng. Spells below the intermediate level cannot shake it?" The top student Zhou Min asked curiously.</p><p>"Yes, although the stone gate looks a bit old, its toughness is no less than steel," Zhang Jianguo walked ahead, holding a tricolor flag like a guide leading students to tour an ancient city.</p><p>Not long after, the buses of the other four groups arrived in succession. One hundred top students from Tianlan Magic High School stood beneath the imposing stone gate.</p><p>There were guard posts on both sides of the stone gate. One of the army mages without a uniform was leisurely playing with a cluster of flames in his hands. The tiny flames, like obedient pets, danced flexibly around his fingertips and occasionally circled him, creating an elegant and magical scene.</p><p>Mo Fan noticed this and was secretly amazed.</p><p>The opponent's small skill at manipulating fire was clearly much more proficient than his own. He wondered if the army brother wearing a uniform had even stronger Fire Surge power.</p><p>"Hey, Leader Zhan Kong, why are you on duty here today?" Luo Yunbo looked up and smiled, chatting with the fire mage playing with flames.</p><p>"Idle moments, I heard that a batch of high school girls will arrive today, so I came specifically to take a look." The man called Zhan Kong did not hide his true nature at all and said with a grin. </p><p>Zhou Min on the side frowned because she could feel that the mage named Zhan Kong was scrutinizing her.</p><p>"He's so handsome."</p><p>"That's right, he can't be compared to those little brats in our school; he has such a masculine aura."</p><p>"And he is particularly honest."</p><p>Several of the love-struck girls couldn't hold back and started chattering excitedly. </p><p>"Little sister, don't frown at our big boss Zhan Kong; he is one of the few strong individuals here." Pan Li jun, who didn't seem to be into bragging like other students, said, her words revealing her admiration for the bearded Zhan Kong.</p><p>"Zhan Kong, I heard that you are precisely that Fire Mage with the highest demon-killing record at Xuefeng Mountain Station!" Zhang Jianguo immediately looked up and shouted loudly, "Long admired, long admired."</p><p>"Just killed a few demons; what's so great about it," Wang Sanpang said.</p><p>"It really isn't impressive. Initially, Deng Kai rejected the idea of having you students come here for internships..." Bearded handsome Zhan Kong said.</p><p>"A year has already passed since the alert period; now there won't be any trouble. A mage must have this kind of experience eventually; we can't stay untrained just because of an alert a year ago," Zhang Jianguo said.</p><p>"I don't really care, but make sure the students don't wander around randomly; I wouldn't want to see such delicate beauties torn apart by one-eyed wolf demons." Zhan Kong laughed heartily.</p><p>Zhang Jianguo gave an awkward laugh.</p><p>Others were true experts; even if he tried to flirt with the girls as a teacher, he couldn't do much.</p><p>An alert period a year ago?</p><p>Mo Fan had heard Mo Qing mention this before, but most of his time was spent in school like a towered scholar, so he knew very little about what terrifying things happened outside.</p>
