						<p>Finally, that damned old professor never told Mo Fan what specific conditions were required for the special admission.</p><p>According to the address provided by Bocheng, Mo Fan and his family finally found their resettlement area.</p><p>There were roughly a thousand people resettled here, just enough to fill an entire residential district.</p><p>At first glance, the district seemed simple and comfortable, but in fact, the entire project was shoddily constructed. The space between floors was extremely low, making it feel like living in a slightly larger box, quite oppressive.</p><p>As Mo Jiaxing put it, having enemies as neighbors was fine; Mo Fan had nothing to complain about.</p><p>Considering Xinxia's situation, the residents' committee arranged for them to live on the first floor. Originally thinking that they would be able to see towering skyscrapers and a blossoming city like Shanghai immediately upon arrival, they found out that looking around the neighborhood revealed it was even more desolate... a post-disaster Bocheng!</p><p>In the outskirts of Shanghai, an extremely rural area, according to the feedback from residents who had already moved in, it took only twenty minutes by bus to reach the subway station, and then another half-hour by subway to see downtown Shanghai...</p><p>In other words, a round trip would take four hours!</p><p>Damnit, if he still had money, Mo Fan would have packed his bags and left. How could he believe that the government-assigned accommodation would be in a city with lush greenery and blooming flowers? This place was worse than Bocheng!</p><p>Money, he needed to make money as soon as possible. After all, he was an intermediate-level mage, and earning money should be relatively quick. He needed to earn enough to move out of this desolate suburban area of Shanghai and rent a place. It felt like monsters could run around in the middle of the night here.</p><p>Mo Jiaxing was very laid-back and quickly found employment, returning to his old job as a driver.</p><p>Xinxia did not plan to go to school. There probably wasn't even a magic academy in this suburban area of Shanghai, and it would be inconvenient to travel back and forth to the city, so she planned to study at home and take the magic college entrance exam next year...</p><p>In fact, healing mages were highly sought after in major hospitals, but Mo Fan didn't want Xinxia to enter society so soon. Given her situation, it was better for her to stay in a beautiful and tranquil campus.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Jiaxing began working at his new job, while Xinxia studied and meditated at home. The two of them seemed very well adapted.</p><p>Mo Fan wasn't idle either. Though they didn't have much money, maintaining their simple lifestyle wasn't too difficult, but ten thousand yuan was far from enough to change their living environment. Moreover, Mo Fan needed that ten thousand yuan to buy the Star Trace.</p><p>The Star Trace is something extremely important to Mo Fan. Inside his magic nebula, there are exactly 49 stars.</p><p>In the past, as long as Mo Fan connected seven stars together, he could release a basic-level magic spell.</p><p>However, the difficulty of intermediate-level magic was exponentially higher than that of basic spells.</p><p>Firstly, Mo Fan had to connect the stars into special star tracks. These tracks then needed to be connected with each other to form a complete star chart, which would open the door to intermediate-level magic and allow him to fully summon the spell.</p><p>For a newly intermediate-level mage, connecting all 49 stars together without any mistakes at the very beginning was practically impossible. On one hand, it was almost impossible to remember the pattern of the star chart, and on the other hand, maintaining such high concentration for a long time was simply unrealistic.</p><p>The Star Trace is a type of magic scroll, and its effect somewhat resembles the Star Chart Book that Teacher Tang Yue gave to Mo Fan.</p><p>Unlike the Star Chart Book, which could directly connect all stars in one go, the Star Trace is more like... if you were to compare a star chart to a Chinese character with many strokes and complex writing order, then the Star Trace would be akin to a practice sheet for each stroke or component of the character.</p><p>Newly intermediate-level mages desperately need the Star Trace to guide and regulate them; otherwise, forming a nonsensical star pattern would make casting magic impossible.</p><p>One Star Trace costs 50,000 units of currency.</p><p>Mo Fan had to buy two: one for fire spells and one for lightning spells.</p><p>This meant that the 100,000 units of currency he had painstakingly earned from the monster hunting squad were spent on these damned magic practice sheets in an instant.</p><p>To stand out as a basic-level mage, noble families would have to spend a lot of money on their children's education. Now, at the intermediate level, it was like robbing them blind; just for an auxiliary control item, 50,000 units! Nowadays, even a decent car costs around 50,000 units—can you afford that?!!</p><p>In short, he didn't have any money to move out in the near future... and it was also perfect to use this desolate place for focused practice!</p><p>What was the fastest way to make money?</p><p>Hunting demons was undoubtedly the answer!</p><p>Without intermediate-level magic, dealing with demons would be extremely difficult. Just thinking about that super violent flaming fist smashing down made Mo Fan excited—what devils and monsters wouldn't turn into cash in his pocket?!!</p><p>Moreover, Mo Fan had not used any intermediate-level lightning spells yet; all the Star Map Books that Teacher Tang Yue had given him were of the fire element. The intermediate-level Flame Fist was already so domineering. As the foremost elemental force, how explosive would lightning spells be?</p><p>Train, train!</p><p>Hurry up and train well! Until I perfect my divine skill, I swear I won’t leave this place!!</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Fan was full of enthusiasm and did not want to waste a day in meditating in the house where he had settled.</p><p>Meditation was an essential practice. Mo Fan roughly estimated that his current mana could only allow him to cast three intermediate-level spells before becoming dizzy. Back then, if it weren’t for Xin Xia’s healing effect, he would have probably fainted when releasing Flame Fist on the terrace.</p><p>After meditation came practicing control…</p><p>There were exactly 49 stars, no longer forming a simple line of star trails but instead creating a much more complex and intertwined star chart. Just looking at those wild, unruly stars made Mo Fan’s head ache, immediately giving him an overwhelming sense of helplessness.</p><p>"Little mudskipper, it all depends on you whether I can keep being awesome… If you don’t assist me in training well, I’ll sell you. Star dust magic artifacts are already selling for a fortune on the market, not to mention a training artifact like you that has consumed the Earth Sage Spring and ascended through countless levels," Mo Fan muttered to Little Mudskipper.</p><p>Having absorbed the Earth Sage Spring, Little Mudskipper had already ascended through an unknown number of levels. Now, Mo Fan had no idea how to appraise Little Mudskipper’s grade.</p><p>In any case, it was absolutely not a mere star dust magic artifact!</p>
