						<p>"Great, it's the Monster Hunt Team." Zhou Min said as if she had been reborn.</p><p>Mo Fan no longer wasted words and quickly retreated from there while the one-eyed magic wolf was frozen.</p><p>As soon as they ran out of the street, they heard Guo Cai Tang using a Bluetooth headset to tell the other team members, "Have we informed Fan Mo? This is an advancing-stage one-eyed magic wolf. If everything goes as expected, it's the same creature that stole from the Sacred Spring with those giant-eyed squirrels. Dealing with the giant-eyed squirrels isn't a problem for us, but this one-eyed magic wolf, which has gained great benefits, has much stronger combat power than ordinary demons. Without lightning magic, we won't be able to control it!"</p><p>"It turns out this audacious beast has been on my father's wanted list for quite some time now. Today we caught it right here," said the tall and thin man standing beside Guo Cai Tang with a gloomy expression. "Just in time, today Yu Ang will join you Monster Hunt Team to eliminate this beast."</p><p>"Don't rush into things; first use Ice Vines from a distance to restrain it. It seems to have been stunned by something earlier, or else our Ice Vines might not freeze it. Let's wait for all our team members to arrive, especially the lightning mage. For dealing with strength-based creatures like one-eyed magic wolves, lightning magic is the best choice!" Guo Cai Tang said seriously.</p><p>"Oh? I'll follow your advice then." Yu Ang nodded and connected his ice-star tracks to attack the one-eyed magic wolf from a distance continuously. Seeming rather relaxed, Yu Ang glanced back at Mo Fan, who was running away with his female classmate, and asked, "Who is this little brat you called him? Do you know him?"</p><p>"It's Mo Fan, that unruly guy who cursed Uncle Zhuo Yun," Guo Cai Tang said through gritted teeth.</p><p>"That's Mo Fan, hehe." Yu Ang couldn't help but flash a scornful smile.</p><p>I thought this guy was so formidable, turns out he acts like a frightened old dog in front of demons, truly hilarious. Looks like the rumor that he had killed the Shadow Wolf Beast during his trials was just good luck; it wasn't even him who did it—those people at the inn loved to spread rumors.</p><p>Is such trash really necessary to appear at my coming-of-age ceremony?</p><p>Well, forget about this mediocre character for now; I need to think carefully about how to handle this advancing-stage one-eyed magic wolf.</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>"Mo Fan, what are you going back for??" Zhou Min brought her grandmother and rushed towards a bustling district.</p><p>"My phone is still there," Mo Fan didn't answer Zhou Min's inquiries and hurriedly ran back.</p><p>As he ran, Mo Fan pulled out his fashionable hooded sweatshirt from that flat backpack of his and casually used a crayon to cover his face in case another mask was needed!</p><p>"Damn, American heroes are all instant action saviors of the city with just a tear in their clothes. I’m really falling behind with my transformation."</p><p>After playing the brave classmate, it was time for him to become the city messenger. He wondered if he would look cool or ridiculous.</p><p>Speaking of which, that guy standing next to Guo Caitang was Mu Zhuoyun’s adopted son, Yu Ang. He was a yinyang person; just looking at him made you know he wasn’t someone good.</p><p>A one-eyed werewolf that sucked the Sacred Spring of Earth??</p><p>What on earth is the Sacred Spring of Earth, and how could it make a normal one-eyed werewolf so terrifying?</p><p>Mo Fan was already different from his first training session. If there had been an Abyssal Wolf in front of him today, he might have managed to handle it, but that one-eyed werewolf clearly seemed much stronger...</p><p>Forget about it for now; hurry back to maintain Earth’s peace.</p><p>They say mutant monsters usually drop good stuff.</p><p>…</p><p>When Mo Fan returned to that old banyan tree district, the other members of the monster hunting team were already there.</p><p>They could be said to be on 24-hour standby. As soon as something happened, they would always arrive at the scene first, much faster than the police.</p><p>"Fan Mo little brother, you arrived pretty quickly!" Fat Stone grinned when he saw that Mo Fan had come.</p><p>"Don’t get distracted; this advanced one-eyed werewolf could kill us in a minute," Captain Xu Dahan said seriously.</p><p>"Yeah, it’s good we have an extra helper today. With two Ice mages, we can significantly restrict the one-eyed werewolf’s movements," Li Wenjie said.</p><p>Guo Caitang and Yu Ang are both outstanding disciples of the Ice Lineage. When their ice vines combine, they have frozen everything within a ten-meter radius around the one-eyed demon wolf. Although the one-eyed demon wolf is not entirely frozen, its movements have become significantly slower.</p><p>These ice vines have a penetration effect; the longer an entity stays in the ice vine area, the more rigid its muscles and bones become. This makes them ideal for dealing with demons like the one-eyed demon wolf that rely solely on strength in battle.</p><p>However, there is still a small problem.</p><p>There are some conflicts between Ice and Fire. The main killing capability of the entire demon-hunting team lies with Captain Xu Dahan, but a single Fire Surge? Explosive Burst from Xu Dahan could shatter Guo Caitang and Yu Ang’s ice vines...</p><p>Therefore, apart from controlling this one-eyed demon wolf, there is no better way for now.</p><p>"I have requested reinforcements. Yang Zuohé of the Mage Association is on his way here. Before he arrives, we will maintain control and do not attempt to kill this one-eyed demon wolf," Xu Dahan said with great experience.</p><p>Fire Surge? Explosive Burst could severely injure this one-eyed demon wolf, but it is not very safe. If the one-eyed demon wolf still has fighting power, controlling it again would be difficult, especially preventing it from fleeing to residential areas!</p><p>"Yang Zuohé, that mid-rank Water Mage?" Xia Ke’s eyes sparkled with admiration.</p><p>"Yes, with him we can safely kill this one-eyed demon wolf. Otherwise, if it escapes, it could cause immeasurable casualties among the civilians," Xu Dahan explained.</p><p>"That is true, but we are unsure how long our ice vines can last. This one-eyed demon wolf's strength is formidable. If we could upgrade our ice vines to Level 3, it would not stand a chance of escaping in this situation," Guo Caitang stated.</p><p>"Don't worry, we're here," Fat Shi and Li Wenjie said together.</p><p>"Should I intervene?" Mo Fan asked, looking at the well-planned group.</p><p>"Stand by for now. Your Level 1 Thunder Seal might not be enough to injure it, but its muscle paralysis effect could play a crucial role. As soon as this one-eyed demon wolf shows any sign of breaking free from the ice... Wait, something's wrong, why is its aura getting stronger?"</p>
