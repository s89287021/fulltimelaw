						<p>Xiao Ke was stunned.</p><p>She had clearly used Water Manipulation to protect Captain Xu Dahan, so why did this one-eyed wolf still tear open the captain's chest!!!!!!</p><p>"Cap…captain!!" Guo Caiyang was completely frozen in shock as well.</p><p>A one-eyed wolf that could ignore Fire Surge? Explosion and directly penetrate through Water Manipulation? Defense, were these really the demons they usually dealt with???</p><p>"Xiao Ke, run quickly!!" At this moment, Fat Stone shouted at Xiao Ke.</p><p>When Xiao Ke regained her senses, she felt like she was immersed in ice water. She sensed the endless cruelty and viciousness in the one-eyed wolf's pupils.</p><p>Its next target was herself!!</p><p>"Thunder Seal? Rampage!"</p><p>As everyone fell into a state of terror, purple lightning marks spread all over Mo Fan's head.</p><p>Raising his hand high, he clenched his fist forcefully!</p><p>Instantly, all the lightning marks transformed into long thunderbolt whip-like strands. These lightning whips crazily lashed at the ferocious one-eyed wolf, tearing its flesh and skin open!</p><p>With each strike of the lightning whip, arcs of electricity immediately pierced through this cruel one-eyed wolf's body, entering its muscles and bones.</p><p>Unlike the initial Thunder Seal? Serpent Marks, these lightning marks resembling whips would transmit electric arcs to each other once multiple strikes landed on them, continuously electrifying the target creature.</p><p>"Ughhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The one-eyed wolf let out a painful howl.</p><p>Its powerful thick muscles and steel-like body might be able to withstand the immense destructive force of Fire Surge? Explosion, but the relentless whipping by Thunder Seal could only inflict superficial injuries. However, its muscles were definitely unable to resist the numbing effect of electricity or the constant transmission of electric arcs through its boiling body.</p><p>"Thunder! The Monoculus Wolf, a creature that relies purely on physical strength, fears lightning magic the most!" At this moment, Guo Caitang exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>"This... This is a Level 2 Thunder Seal!!" Fat Stone also looked rather stunned.</p><p>When even their monster-hunting team was at a loss for what to do, they least expected one of their new members, who had only recently joined the team, to step forward.</p><p>Worst of all, this kid had somehow cultivated the Thunder Seal to Level 2!!</p><p>The Monoculus Wolf was already undergoing changes akin to a metamorphosis in its muscles, blood, and bones. This transformation gave the Monoculus Wolf almost the terrifying combat power of an advanced creature, and at such a time, there was nothing more effective than lightning magic specialized for explosive muscle creatures!</p><p>Elsewhere, Mo Fan took a long breath from his distance.</p><p>Fortunately, the Level 2 Thunder Seal was indeed effective; otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p>"Continue, Vanmo, keep going! Your Thunder Seal is preventing its muscles and bones from growing further. As long as we can suppress its advancement, we'll be saved!" Guo Caitang said urgently.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>The star orbit connected again, and a purple lightning seal mark appeared once more above Mo Fan's head.</p><p>Although Mo Fan was still somewhat unfamiliar with the Level 2 Thunder Seal, he could not afford any mistakes in this life-or-death situation.</p><p>The lightning whip lashed at the Monoculus Wolf's misshapen body once more. This time, the frantic whipping not only suppressed the Monoculus Wolf again but also caused its swollen and growing body to show signs of retracting.</p><p>"Good job, Vanmo!!"</p><p>"It's suppressed!!!"</p><p>"Hurk it back to its original form! Hurk it back to its original form!"</p><p>"Thunder Seal's paralyzing effect cannot last forever. Once the one-eyed wolf adapts to the electric shock, it may swell up again!" Guo Caitang reminded everyone.</p><p>Mo Fan himself was acutely aware that the control effect of the Thunder Seal could not be sustained indefinitely.</p><p>Regardless, by stalling for some time, Mo Fan felt he had done his best; at least Li Wenjie successfully managed to drag Xu Daguang to a safe place. As for Captain Xu Daguang's fate, it was uncertain.</p><p>"Uuuuuuuuuuuu~~~~~~~~~~!!!"</p><p>A wolf howl echoed as the one-eyed wolf finally adapted to the Thunder Seal's paralysis, and this energy-filled monster released its wild beast aura once more.</p><p>"Oh no, it's about to transform again!"</p><p>The crowd's expressions changed yet again, indicating that their lives were once more in mortal danger.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Mo Fan knew he was truly powerless.</p><p>Now they could only retreat. His Thunder Seal had at least bought some time for the innocent civilians and saved some lives.</p><p>"Abominable beast, you still refuse to die!!!"</p><p>A solemn shout echoed through the old street.</p><p>Without seeing anyone, Mo Fan sensed a massive elemental force gathering in mid-air, with faint mist droplets falling on his face.</p><p>"Sssssssss~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Mo Fan looked up in astonishment and discovered an enormous wave had appeared in mid-air at some point!!</p><p>A surging wave in the air??</p><p>Mo Fan could hardly believe his eyes, but that surging wave indeed rolled over the old eaves and then rushed onto the one-eyed wolf like a flood breaking through a dam.</p><p>"Wave Surge!"</p><p>With this sacred magical sound, the raging water pushed the one-eyed wolf to the ground and turned into a flood that instantly inundated the entire street of old banyan trees.</p><p>Almost all the banyan trees were uprooted, and parts of the walls of the old houses collapsed. The once extremely aggressive one-eyed wolf had no room to resist under this wave and flood; it was swept from the center of the street all the way to the end!</p><p>"M…Mid-rank Water Magic!!" Xiao Ke's face turned bright red with excitement at seeing this scene!</p><p>Wave Surge!</p><p>This was precisely the mid-rank skill of water magic. Watching that surge of waves, powerful enough to flood an entire street, made Xiao Ke, another water mage, feel as if he would faint from excitement.</p><p>Mid-rank! His long-desired mid-rank! When would a small mage like him reach this level?</p><p>The wave surged powerfully in front of them but did not involve anyone else. What everyone could see was the wave rushing over the one-eyed wolf like a fierce dragon, almost destroying that entire old street!</p><p>Mo Fan also watched this scene intently; at that moment, his heart was pounding as well!</p><p>Mid-rank magic! This was mid-rank magic, too powerful!!!!</p>
