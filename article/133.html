						<p>"I'll stand here and finish you off." Mo Fan didn't rush in; he only stood far away.</p><p>"You can try, but with your miserable mana just entering the intermediate stage, even if you release all your Flame Punches, you won't be able to break my Water Abundant Shield. You can see that woman; she has already been ensnared by my Evil Spider Trap. Soon, she will be drained of her life like those people before!!" Despite his severe internal pain, Chao He, even seriously injured, still resembled a dangerous monster.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at Teacher Tang Yue; indeed, there were some faint black spider threads around her body at this moment. These black threads seemed to be invading her skin, clearly very similar to the situation of those four Eastern Clan men before...</p><p>This Chao He had long included Tang Yue in his plans as well; it was unknown how his curse trap managed to ensnare her. It was too bizarre.</p><p>"Do you want to use my beautiful teacher's life to threaten me? In fact, I am a cowardly person who fears death and will not make meaningless sacrifices. So even if you kill her, I won't surrender. Then... how about this: I won't attempt to break your Water Abundant Shield; you release the curse and let her go. The Fire Elemental would be yours, while the four Eastern Clan members' remains would be mine. How does that sound?" Mo Fan said from afar.</p><p>Chao He was clearly stunned for a moment.</p><p>Could he say that he thought the same thing in his heart?</p><p>To be honest, it was unclear whether the Water Abundant Shield could block the impact of four or five Flame Punches. Even if it did manage to block them all, his internal organs would likely shatter.</p><p>Losing such an enticing Yuwu-level Female Judge was a great loss; perhaps the purpose of storing away the Fire Elemental would be achieved. This deal Chao He was definitely willing to make.</p><p>It just felt strange that this offer came from someone else. The other party didn't seem like a good person either, otherwise why did they agree so readily?</p><p>"What you gain is not just the remains of those four Eastern Clan members..." Chao He said with a lecherous smile, glancing at the female judge whose cheeks were already flushed.</p><p>"Don't be in such a hurry; I currently control the curse and won't let it take her life directly. During this time, I will refine this Meiyan. Once I finish refining it, then you can take her away," Chao He said.</p><p>"How do I know you won't attack her immediately after finishing your refinement?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"The curse takes some time to entangle the life soul; you can confirm this with her yourself. Of course, during the time you try to break my Water Abundant Shield with Flame Punches, I guarantee she will die. Rest assured, in deals for mutual benefit, I have always been honest."</p><p>Indeed, the curse did take some time to entangle the life soul. Now Chao He was rushing to take Meiyan away, afraid that this brat might directly kill him without even considering his beautiful teacher's life. If so, he might be annihilated on the spot.</p><p>Moreover, if we continue to delay, once others arrive here, we will be in big trouble. Especially when facing light mages and psychic mages, the curse trap will be completely ineffective against them.</p><p>"Even a psychopathic murderer practices honesty; this makes me, a great magic enthusiast, feel somewhat embarrassed."</p><p>Mo Fan confirmed with Tang Yue that the curse would take her life, and he also deduced from Chao He's attitude that the only trick this guy had other than Water Shield was nothing!</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>"Nothing much, just, who said I have to use fire magic?" Mo Fan’s voice suddenly became stern and cold in the forest.</p><p>At the same time, one could see beautiful purple lightning star tracks weaving beneath Mo Fan's feet. They longed to break free from all constraints, yearning to transform into the power summoned by his palm, making everything before them tremble in humiliation!</p><p>Although the summoning speed of the Lightning Star Chart Book was not fast, Mo Fan had already gained enough time during his "friendly consultation" with Chao He.</p><p>Chao He could sense through his mind that Mo Fan was just an intermediate-level mage and even knew he had not undergone a second awakening. However, Chao He never imagined that Mo Fan had obtained dual-element mastery upon his first awakening!</p><p>When the furious lightning power abruptly rose in the forest, Chao He's face was filled with shock.</p><p>Water Shield is very effective against intermediate fire magic, but when facing lightning… it was like a decoration. Lightning can directly penetrate water!</p><p>With the appearance of the Lightning Star Chart Book, Chao He could not run away in time, let alone wrap the curse around Tang Yue’s life soul. The time given to him was too short!</p><p>If it were another element, Chao He still had a fighting chance. But against lightning magic with his current physical condition and that pitiful Water Shield… if one had to describe Cao He's inner thoughts, they would be just like Mo Fan's earlier: he felt like he had encountered a natural-born dual-element mage—f*cked!</p><p>…</p><p>Lightning, the leader of elements.</p><p>An entry-level skill is already equivalent to three, extremely furious. Even at intermediate level, lightning magic remains the most violent and domineering!!</p><p>If Rock Army Magic Armor were still there, he would not fear Mo Fan at all. Now he felt like the end was near.</p><p>"Pilie Lightning · Thunder Strike"</p><p>Mo Fan coldly recited as his hand suddenly shot upward!</p><p>Pointing at the sky, a purple bolt of lightning struck out of nowhere, splitting the space in half. The thick purple body emitted a sharp cry and rushed swiftly toward Zhao He standing in the pit.</p><p>The lightning strike was incredibly fast, a true flash of lightning on a clear day.</p><p>When Thunder Strike landed, the already uneven ground around Zhao He suddenly sank and crumbled!</p><p>"Boom~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>An explosion sounded as the previously living Zhao He was instantly torn apart by the ferocious force of the lightning, blood spraying in a gruesome sight.</p><p>The lightning struck too quickly; even Zhao He’s sudden death from being torn apart wasn’t particularly horrific. The thunder and lightning had shattered his limbs into countless pieces, resembling red droplets scattering everywhere—there was no trace of the monstrous murderer Zhao He anymore?</p><p>...</p><p>Whether it was the intermediate Wind Magic, Wind Disc · Cyclone, or Fire Magic, Fiery Fist · Heaven Shattering, they all had a formidable opening stage, either abruptly sucking air away or bringing waves of heat. This intermediate Lightning Magic, however, showed no clear signs whatsoever…</p><p>Finger, Thunder Drop!</p><p>Simple and brutal!!</p><p>That Water Shield was completely useless!!</p><p>Zhao He died too suddenly, without time to fear, without time to suffer. His flesh had already turned into a shower of blood, with his soul likely standing there in shock, unable to savor the exquisite Female Judge or even have the opportunity to elevate his flames to Spirit Rank. There was no chance for him to act recklessly or harbor resentment toward that naturally talented dual-elemental boy who killed him.</p>
