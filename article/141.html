						<p>They all say that time flies by quickly, and once it is filled with activities, it will pass in an instant.</p><p>In fact, to Mo Fan, he felt like he had already cultivated for nearly several worlds. That kind of cultivation would only make the original time feel even longer.</p><p>The martial arts novels that said years of rigorous practice would go by in a blink were all lies. Having personally experienced this period of seclusion and cultivation, Mo Fan was about to be driven mad with boredom. He had countless times wanted to go out and enjoy himself but ultimately resisted the urge.</p><p>This seclusion made Mo Fan fully realize that whether it was the boundless sea of knowledge or the endless magic, they were all long and arduous journeys.</p><p>Without perseverance, nothing could be accomplished.</p><p>In any case, this year, Mo Fan had gone through rigorous practice.</p><p>"Come, come, have a chicken leg. Tomorrow is your chance to retake the exam. Make sure you get into a good magical academy... Well, with your dual elemental talent, I bet that many prestigious schools would want to admit you."</p><p>Mr. Mo made a feast and said to Mo Fan with a beaming smile.</p><p>"I don't plan on revealing my dual elemental talent," Mo Fan said.</p><p>After much thought, Mo Fan decided to keep a low profile.</p><p>The deaths of those four intermediate mages from the Eastern Aristocratic Family still fresh in his memory made Mo Fan realize that having strong foundations did not necessarily guarantee invincibility. It was always better to keep some tricks up one's sleeve.</p><p>Moreover, cultivating fire and lightning elements now basically required him to work hard on completing the star map by himself. The school might not be able to provide much help.</p><p>"Then what are you going to take the exam with??" Mr. Mo asked in confusion.</p><p>"Summoning."</p><p>"When did you awaken your Summoning ability?" Mr. Mo asked blankly.</p><p>Xia Xin also looked at Mo Fan with wide eyes.</p><p>Mo Fan was indeed planning to take the entrance exam for Ming Zhu University, but he intended to focus solely on one faculty—Summoning. If Mo Fan remembered correctly, boosting Stardust to Level 3 during the entrance exams was already considered remarkable; back then, Mu Zhuo Yun even held a feast for Yu Ang's jade pond.</p><p>Although Mo Fan had never used Summoning skills before, he had already researched Ming Zhu University's requirements. Informing the examiners that his primary faculty was Summoning and that he genuinely achieved Level 3 Stardust would be grounds for special admission!</p><p>In simple terms, it was akin to the bonus points system for ethnic minorities in college entrance exams.</p><p>The probability of awakening the Summoning faculty as a primary faculty was even lower than that of the Lightning faculty. It wasn't just about being an ethnic minority; it was almost like an endangered species.</p><p>While one Lightning faculty student could still emerge among over a thousand, with millions of national examinees and Ming Zhu University's prestigious reputation, your Lightning faculty would only be so-so... given their rigorous selection process of choosing the best from thousands across the nation.</p><p>Ming Zhu University offered special bonus points for three faculties: Curses in Black Magic, Spatial Manipulation in Dimensional Magic, and Summoning.</p><p>Mo Fan initially intended to apply with a more mature Shadow faculty. However, Ming Zhu University's standards were indeed very high; even if you mastered Level 3 basic Shadow skill—Shadow Concealment—you might still not be accepted.</p><p>The entrance exam for magical arts was also a process of elimination, where countless talented and hardworking young mages emerged nationwide. The universities' evaluations focused on cultivation levels and skills, which could only be considered basic criteria. What the examiners really wanted to see were unique abilities that would truly impress them...</p><p>When it came to unique abilities, Mo Fan had quite a few. Why did he choose Summoning as his faculty?</p><p>Firstly, it was to better showcase himself on such an splendid stage at university. Secondly, it was because of his response to Mo Jia Xing and Xin Xia's question: "Since the Summoning faculty enjoys significant bonus points at Ming Zhu University, why should I go through all that trouble to apply for another one?"</p><p>...</p><p>To others, magical arts entrance exams were a matter of life or death. To Mo Fan, it was merely a process.</p><p>Mo Fan did not take the formal exam but opted for an interview. This method existed in his original world as well.</p><p>The interview took place within Ming Zhu University. Mo Fan had already directly demonstrated his Summoning faculty abilities. After the five examiners asked some in-depth magical knowledge questions, they proceeded to test the intensity of his Stardust.</p><p>"sss, it seems you have reached our minimum admission standard, but you have never used a summoning skill, which makes it difficult for us to decide. Although summoning skills are the least in need of practice, the challenge lies in how to control the summoned creatures." The professor with thick glasses examined Mo Fan carefully.</p><p>Summoning is less common; we just don't know whether to accept this student or not.</p><p>His basic skills are solid, but he has nothing outstanding about him. He's unlikely to break through to an intermediate level in a short time.</p><p>Considering that there are very few summoning students applying to our Pearl Academy this year, we can't even fill one dormitory.</p><p>"Director Lu mentioned that they spotted a soil mage who excels in all aspects, especially the use of earth waves, which creates an effect similar to quicksand and traps a trial beast," said the male examiner with a tie.</p><p>"So, it means they can only choose one of them?" asked the professor wearing glasses.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Alright, Mo Fan, since you have already mastered seven summoning stars, let's see your first summoning. This will determine whether we select you or that soil mage."</p><p>Mo Fan thought for a moment and found this reasonable.</p><p>After all, he had never tried the basic summoning skill of his summoning lineage—Dimensional Summoning.</p><p>"We'll give you one week to prepare. Afterward, come to the trial ground, and we will invite a senior from the Summoning Department to evaluate… Oh, if it's your first summoning, we recommend using some auxiliary items. This increases the chances of summoning stronger creatures. We have no problem with you using such aids," said the professor kindly.</p><p>"Thank you, teachers."</p><p>As soon as he left the interview room, Mo Fan's face showed some odd expressions.</p><p>To be honest, he knew nothing about the specifics of summoning skills. All year long, he had been focused on refining his basic skills.</p><p>If not for the old professor's reminder to use auxiliary items during the first summoning, he might have done it poorly.</p><p>Mo Fan had seen some general introductions.</p><p>The Summoning Magic "Dimensional Summon" is the most volatile among all skills, and to a certain extent, it also depends on luck.</p><p>If lucky, one can summon an incredibly powerful creature, making the initial combat strength even more terrifying than that of a Lightning Magic user.</p><p>If unlucky, one might summon some bizarre, comedic creature... which wouldn't even be as intimidating as keeping a dog!</p><p>Fortunately, this time Mo Fan's summoning would serve as an entry examination, and he was looking forward to it very much.</p><p>As for auxiliary items, those definitely need to be found.</p><p>The Oriental Pearl Magic Tower is filled with mages of various disciplines from all over the country, so there should certainly be someone selling such things...</p>
