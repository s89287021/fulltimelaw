						<p>Hangzhou is very close to Shanghai, or more precisely, the outskirts of Shanghai almost touch those of Hangzhou.</p><p>Mo Fan arrived at a small southern town north of Hangzhou according to the mature and charming Miss Tang Yue's instructions.</p><p>The town was called Xixi, which sounded rather poetic. However, when Mo Fan arrived there by car, he discovered that the town was full of cracked soil and abandoned fields, vastly different from what he imagined as a picturesque water town in southern China.</p><p>Where’s the damn water? Not to mention rivers, there wasn’t even a stream to be seen, making it a huge problem just to soak one's feet.</p><p>Look at those round, plump buttocks, those magnificent twin peaks. Miss Tang Yue, are you sure your last name isn’t Cang?</p><p>Tang Yue seemed to sense Mo Fan and swept her hair away with a carefree gesture. Her bright eyes gazed at the person who had arrived for the appointment, smiling.</p><p>"Miss Tang Yue is still as beautiful and enchanting as ever," Mo Fan couldn't help but compliment her.</p><p>"You’re not bad either; so young and already an intermediary mage, you must be considered a genius even in major families and associations," Tang Yue responded with a smile.</p><p>"You aren’t that old yourself, yet I can’t see your strength clearly," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Alright, stop pretending. I know you want to ask where I was during the Bocai disaster," Tang Yue said directly.</p><p>"Well, I do want to know because it seems like Miss Tang Yue isn’t just an intermediary mage... Your identity must be extraordinary as well. I just don’t understand why you came to teach at Tianlan Magic High School, could it be that you’re doing something secretive? Or perhaps, are you actually the mastermind behind the Black Papacy?" Mo Fan said.</p><p>Tang Yue rolled her eyes.</p><p>This student has such an active imagination.</p><p>"Do you know about the adjudication committee of the Magic Association?" Tang Yue asked.</p><p>"I’ve heard a bit about it; they’re said to be a group of highest-ranking enforcers who specialize in apprehending mages who violate treaties," Mo Fan replied.</p><p>"Alright, I am one of them. In fact, we were aware of the Black Vatican's plans in Bohemian City. Unfortunately, we did not anticipate that they would lay such a large-scale conspiracy. With just my strength, I can only restrain the guy named Saul from the Black Vatican; the rest will have to be left to Shanjong and company... It's also my own fault. If I had realized their intentions earlier, this disaster could have been avoided," Tang Yue said without trying to hide anything from Mo Fan, stating it directly.</p><p>"You've only been in Bohemian City for less than two years, while those people have been plotting for over ten years, planting spies and formulating plans. Clearly, the higher-ups haven't taken Bohemian City seriously enough; otherwise, why would they send you alone to infiltrate there?" Mo Fan said.</p><p>The disaster in Bohemian City was clearly well-planned. Since the Inquisition has already become aware of it, and since Tang Yue has been staying in Bohemian City, the people on the side of the Inquisition are not fools.</p><p>"Now, all news media is buzzing about the disaster in Bohemian City, and the Black Vatican's information has been completely disclosed. I have also submitted all the information I obtained. The higher-ups of the Inquisition have taken over this matter, and I believe it won't take long for the Inquisition to give Bohemian City justice," Tang Yue said.</p><p>"Let's drop this heart-wrenching topic. What business do you need me for? Is there something wrong with this town? Why does it look so desolate."</p><p>Tang Yue said seriously, "Indeed, as you observed, all water resources in this Water Diversion Town have dried up, just like the droughts in the northwest."</p><p>"Do some strange forces act here?" Mo Fan asked instinctively.</p><p>Having spent time in the city monster-hunting team, Mo Fan had a habit of attributing unusual things to the mischief of certain demons. Thinking that there were no demons in big cities was too naive; the larger the city, the more demons lurked, and they did not spare their victims!</p><p>"I'm not quite sure. It seems this strange phenomenon has also occurred in other towns. My leads are currently limited, which is why I need your help," Tang Yue said.</p><p>"You've certainly found the right person. Before becoming a magician, I aspired to be a detective. While I haven't watched 700 episodes of Conan, I have seen over 600. I'm proficient in various... Oh, what I mean is, you can entrust any task to me." Just as Mo Fan was about to go on at length, he had no choice but to speak seriously.</p><p>"My identity is sensitive and easily discovered. Follow that person later; if everything goes smoothly, this guy, who we are wanted for by the Inquisition, will likely have some answers," Tang Yue pointed out a man outside the corridor window, dressed in stylish attire.</p><p>"What's wrong with him?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"I'm not sure, but from experience, when something is unusual, there must be demons involved. These demons are often corrupted magicians. Many of these morally corrupt magicians have committed countless heinous acts, even murders and robberies. Despite his well-groomed appearance, like a wealthy gentleman from Hangzhou, the number of magicians he has killed... accurately speaking, is no less than that of demons," Tang Yue said seriously.</p><p>Tang Yue hoped Mo Fan understood that she had not brought him here to play but to face morally corrupt magicians who never cared about others' lives and would directly target vital areas in a fight.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, summoning me for such an extremely vicious magician... I'm afraid I can't handle it."</p><p>"I originally planned to dispatch a mid-level lightning mage, but he was too far away. By the time he arrived, that guy would already have escaped. I know this is somewhat dangerous for you, but if you take him down for me, I can promise to help you awaken your shadow magic." Tang Yue also knew that such matters were rather strained for Mo Fan, who was still a student. However, Tang Yue truly did not want this fugitive mage to go unchecked.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, your matter is my matter; there's no need to be so formal. I'll go after him right now and make sure I check his entire background records."</p><p>"You little rogue, you wouldn't do things properly if I didn't give you some incentive, would you?" Tang Yue glared at Mo Fan without good grace, and that slightly angry yet adorable appearance was particularly alluring.</p>
