						<p>He……He Yu!!!</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou wanted to roar from the depths of his throat, but a sharp pain blocked it, preventing him from shouting.</p><p>Numerous water droplets scattered in front of Zhang Xiaohou. They seemed like He Yu's life falling, vanishing after hitting the ground.</p><p>"Wind Track!! Wind Track!! Wind Track!!!!"</p><p>Driven by intense heartache, Zhang Xiaohou frantically connected star tracks until a gust of wind enveloped him.</p><p>Riding on the wind's trajectory, Zhang Xiaohou wildly snatched He Yu from the vicious claws of another monstrous beast. Her face was already blood-red.</p><p>Using the wind track to dodge, he swiftly carried He Yu away to a distance, but her blood scattered all over the place...</p><p>It couldn't be stopped. The monstrous beast was like an executioner, able to accurately find vital arteries. Once cut, it would continue bleeding until completely drained.</p><p>"Why did you use water magic to protect me? Protect yourself! You can't even save yourself, stupid!"</p><p>"Teacher Xue, quickly save He Yu! Please save her! There must be a way!!"</p><p>"F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, I'm going to kill you, you f*cking bastard!!"</p><p>The screams echoed in everyone's ears. Just as no one expected Instructor Baiyang to be from the Black Church, they also never imagined He Yu protecting Zhang Xiaohou like this, her blood red beyond belief, causing everyone's hearts to tighten.</p><p>Holding He Yu, she looked at him with pale purple cheeks.</p><p>Her eyes were wide open, and her black pupils still held many emotions in their final moments. Perhaps a touch of relief, as she had finally released the water magic at a critical moment and protected someone's life as Teacher Xue said; perhaps a sense of peace, as this thin boy risked his life to save her during training, and today she saved him; most of all, longing, for she still had too many beautiful wishes left unfulfilled like other girls.</p><p>"Hahaha, it seems you little guys have made some progress. I thought my black beast would kill them both in one strike, but I didn't expect one to survive. However, this instructor taught you a lesson today, making you understand not to easily trust anyone. Unfortunately, this will be your final lesson in life because none of you can leave this bridge alive!" Baiyang said maniacally from the center.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, those two black beasts lunged at their classmates again.</p><p>The black beast demons were nearly the same size as humans. They were nearly twice as fast as giant-eyed squirrels, and once they darted into a shadowy area, it was almost impossible to see their figures clearly.</p><p>These overly agile creatures could be considered executioners for novice mages. They could land a fatal strike before you even completed your magic spell and could easily dodge the chaotic attacks of mages!</p><p>"Hurry, get back!" Xue Mubing shouted.</p><p>Everyone had already experienced how terrifying the black beast demons were. If they got close to any student, their fate would be like He Yu's, with continuous bleeding.</p><p>On the other side, standing in front of Mo Fan was a robust ghost wolf beast. This fierce creature must have hurt its paws on the shield so much that it could not attack Mo Fan for a short time, but it stared at him fiercely with its furious eyes.</p><p>Mo Fan's chest rose and fell dramatically. Upon hearing Zhang Xiaohou's heart-wrenching cries, rage burned intensely in his abdomen.</p><p>In He Yu's eyes, seeing Instructor Bai Yang should have meant absolute safety, yet he never imagined that this Instructor Bai Yang was even more vicious than a demon, devouring without mercy. Looking at his mocking face, he wished he could punch it to pieces!!</p><p>"Roar~~~~~~~~~~!!"</p><p>The ghost wolf beast opened its mouth, with something churning in the depths of its throat. With one roar, a turbulent wave surged toward Mo Fan fiercely.</p><p>Flying sand and stones!</p><p>This was the ghost wolf beast's specialty. It could attack distant enemies without using its claws.</p><p>The yellow flying sand and stones came rushing at Mo Fan, but he had prepared in advance. He performed a flexible somersault and quickly hid behind a van.</p><p>The van's metal body was hit by the flying sand and stones, making it jingle and rattle, full of holes, causing the entire van to shake violently.</p><p>Mo Fan leaned against the van, and his eyes emitted purple light. This light grew stronger, forming a gorgeous streak of purple shooting stars around him.</p><p>Seven stars shone brightly in the star trail, passing on lightning power to each other, quickly condensing into a large area of swirling lightning seals around Mo Fan.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Mo Fan exhaled deeply, turning around before the sandstorm had completely subsided, and stared directly at the ghost wolf beast.</p><p>"One year ago, I killed something like you. Killing you today is as easy as killing a dog!" Mo Fan roared, with not an ounce of fear in his eyes.</p><p>With one hand raised high, he clenched his fist forcefully, issuing the Lightning Order. The restless lightning elements in the air transformed into enraged weapons and plummeted towards the ghost wolf beast.</p><p>The ghost wolf beast attempted to dodge but failed, as Mo Fan had already locked onto all possible escape routes.</p><p>The ghost wolf beast instantly lost its ability to move and could no longer approach Mo Fan in the slightest.</p><p>Mo Fan coldly curled his lips. Shortly after releasing the Lightning Seal, his pupils shimmered with a red glow, and to his surprise, he had already half-clenched a ball of scorching flames in his other hand.</p><p>Lightning first!</p><p>Fire next!!</p><p>The two most powerful spells for damage in the entire elemental domain would be experienced by this damned ghost wolf beast.</p><p>After countless practices and experiments, Mo Fan could now release the Fire Dart with remarkable precision. Indeed, the small fireball, with its clear target, instantly struck the ghost wolf beast's slightly raised head and drifted into its mouth.</p><p>"Explode!" Mo Fan roared with eyes like torches, synchronizing his intent perfectly with the explosive effect of the Level 3 Fire Dart.</p><p>Though the small fireball seemed to have no power, it suddenly exploded violently inside the ghost wolf beast's mouth upon Mo Fan's command.</p><p>(Update Notification: Due to going out, I will update two chapters each day for the next three days. Please don't complain about my slow updates; who could compete with me updating 4000 words daily for VIP chapters? I'm able to maintain three updates a day for the new book, which is truly astonishing. Additionally, in a few days, there will be some good news regarding this book, and I'll offer you all the most sincere benefits~~ The details are still uncertain, so I won't say more for now! )</p><p>(Two chapters have been updated today. You don't need to wait for the chapter at midnight; check it out again tomorrow noon~~)</p>
