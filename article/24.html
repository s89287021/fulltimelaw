						<p>Zhang Xiaohou glanced at his class teacher, Xue Musheng, and then at their practical lesson teacher, Tang Yue.</p><p>"Good luck, I believe in you," said the practical lesson teacher, Tang Yue this time.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou nodded and walked to the side of the Star Sensation Stone.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Zhang Xiaohou adjusted his breathing, slowly entering a meditative state.</p><p>The Star Sensation Stone shimmered with a patchy glow that fluctuated with Zhang Xiaohou's breath, clearly indicating that he was somewhat nervous, as the stone could not fully capture his stellar energy.</p><p>However, Zhang Xiaohou was gradually getting into the right state.</p><p>"a!"</p><p>"a!"</p><p>"a+!"</p><p>The three examiners seemed to have different opinions.</p><p>"Teacher, can I try again?"</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou was clearly not satisfied with his score and entered the state once more.</p><p>This time, he was much calmer.</p><p>A dense glow spread around the Star Sensation Stone, clearly stronger than He Yu’s, and there were no unstable flickers this time.</p><p>The three examiners looked at each other and nodded.</p><p>"a+"</p><p>"a+"</p><p>"a+"</p><p>"The final grade, a+."</p><p>As soon as the grades were announced, all the students in the class revealed expressions of surprise and envy.</p><p>"Dang, an a+, that's the kind of grade you need to get into the advanced class. Zhang Xiaohou is usually just an ordinary student; I never expected him to be so outstanding. I misjudged him, I really did."</p><p>"That's amazing. If I could get an a+, my dad would buy me a car as a gift."</p><p>Teacher Xue Musheng and Teacher Tang Yue both smiled and nodded approvingly.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou had always been a student they favored, so it made sense that he got this grade.</p><p>"Student, you can stop now. We will announce the final results based on..."</p><p>The bald examiner was about to declare the final outcome.</p><p>"Teacher, I want to take another test," Zhang Xiaohou said firmly but somewhat shyly.</p><p>"Are you sure?" the examiner asked in surprise.</p><p>"I know that if my grade is high in the annual assessment, it will take longer to obtain a Stardust Artifact, so I need to take the release test," Zhang Xiaohou stated confidently.</p><p>Teacher Xue Musheng and Teacher Tang Yue still smiled, as they had long known that Zhang Xiaohou was already at the release level.</p><p>There were two tests in total.</p><p>The first one was the Stardust Test.</p><p>Most students can continue their studies at the Magic High School as long as they pass this stage. The second stage, however, is designed for top students; among the more than a thousand students, around a hundred have already reached the level of releasing skills in this field. If one can fully release their own school's skill during the examination, their annual assessment score will naturally be higher! To secure limited school resources, all students will put their best abilities on display during the annual assessment, leaving no secrets hidden. ... Zhang Xiaohou's release test was not particularly smooth. Despite his nervousness, he ultimately failed to connect the seven wind elemental stars into a star track. However, the examiners could see that this was a student who had mastered the release technique but faltered due to exam anxiety. Based on his performance, they still awarded him some additional points. Zhang Xiaohou walked out of the examination hall with a touch of disappointment, looking down slightly. Ms. Tang Yue patted his shoulder like a gentle big sister and said, "Don't be discouraged; with your scores, you're definitely going to get into the advanced class." "Teacher, I thought I was already very proficient. I didn't expect that even a little bit of nervousness would cause me to lose control of the stars each time, forcing me to start over. How did Teacher manage to complete magic release effortlessly?" Zhang Xiaohou asked. "Of course, it's practice. But mindset is also crucial; a qualified mage not only needs solid foundational skills but also an unperturbed attitude in handling matters." Zhang Xiaohou nodded somewhat vaguely. "Next up, Huang Feifeng." "B!" "Teacher, I'm A! I'm A!" "Any more noise and your score will be canceled."</p><p>"The next one is Luo Si."</p><p>"c!"</p><p>Luo Si, the student, jumped up in excitement.</p><p>For him, a C was like getting a new year present.</p><p>...</p><p>In Class Eight, students were being tested one after another. Most of them got B's and C's, with not many A's around.</p><p>"Look, look, the school leaders are almost here."</p><p>"They're at Class Seven's testing room... The person being tested is that guy from the Thunder clan."</p><p>"Hsu Zhao Ting, he's definitely number one in the whole school!"</p><p>"It's not certain; I heard Mu Bai has very high cultivation!"</p><p>Mo Fan overheard his classmates' discussions and looked towards Class Seven's testing room.</p><p>Sure enough, the group of school leaders, along with the notably outstanding Mu Ning Xue, had arrived nearby.</p><p>...</p><p>"Brother Mu Zhuoyun, this is our academically excellent student from the Thunder clan. His name is Hsu Zhao Ting. A year ago, after he awakened his Thunder clan power, I, as the principal, paid special attention to him. He's now in the release phase test. Take a look," said the principal of Tian Lan High School to Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>The principal being so courteous towards Mu Zhuoyun showed just how highly regarded Mu Zhuoyun was in Bocheng.</p><p>"Ning Xue, take a look at this younger brother's performance."</p><p>"Uh-huh." Mu Ningxue nodded.</p><p>The Lightning Element, the leader of elemental magic, possesses a fierce destructive power that makes other mages cower in fear!</p><p>Inside the examination hall, Xu Zhaoting, wearing his school uniform, was already standing there. He was adjusting his breathing and trying to calm himself under the pressure of the entire school's gaze.</p><p>Since he entered the school, he had become the focus of everyone's attention. These gazes constantly urged him to study diligently.</p><p>"Follow my command!"</p><p>"Elemental leader, Lightning!"</p><p>"Lightning Seal!"</p><p>As the words fell, his hand rose.</p><p>Purple lightning arcs erupted violently, resembling soldiers summoned by a king cobra. They twisted their horrifying bodies, igniting the air in scorching flames!</p><p>Release!</p><p>The lightning arcs rained down madly, pounding fiercely onto the puppet.</p><p>The puppet trembled violently, turning black as the Lightning Seal descended with overwhelming force. The crackling thunder and searing marks beat against it, reducing the puppet to a shattered mess in an instant.</p><p>On the training ground, black gullies formed on the ground, looking terrifying.</p><p>The devastated puppet was now just a pile of black debris.</p><p>The domineering Lightning Element skill instantly captured everyone's attention in the examination hall, making even the top students who could release their own spells gasp in surprise.</p><p>My goodness, what wind currents, what water flows, and what fire surges are all weak compared to this. The dominance of that Lightning Seal is something no other element can match; it actually reduced the puppet to rubble. This destructive power...</p><p>If there had been someone standing there, I would have voted directly! (I heard that after midnight 12 o'clock, if you still haven't voted with your recommendation ticket, some unclean thing will come into your room. So, do you want to vote now or be woken up in the middle of the night by someone whispering hoarsely in your ear: "Puuuush~~~~ recoooooommmmmmmeeeennnd~~~~~~~~ ticket")</p>
