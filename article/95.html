						<p>The safety isolation zone was jointly established by the Magic Association and the Hunters Alliance, where there were mages guarding it and a grand barrier protecting it. It was about three kilometers away from the mountain in the city where Mo Fan was located. However, relying solely on his own strength, Mo Fan did not believe he could safely pass through this three-kilometer urban area that was already infested with numerous demons.</p><p>"Although they lack experience, they are still mages. I need to evacuate together with them to the safety isolation zone," Mo Fan said.</p><p>If he encountered a demon, Mo Fan would use both his lightning and fire magic; although he might not be able to completely kill it, he wouldn’t be killed either. However, looking down from this height, it was clearly evident that the one-eyed wolf demons were not always fighting alone. If there were just two one-eyed wolf demons appearing, Mo Fan would be unable to handle them.</p><p>In any case, it was best to first meet up with his classmates from school; his strength alone was too insignificant in this disaster unless he could reach a level like Commander Jian Kong’s.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan quickly headed toward Tianlan Magic High School. Going downhill from the city mountain and passing through several old alleys would lead him to the side gate of Tianlan Magic High School.</p><p>Fortunately, this area had not yet been thoroughly ravaged by demons. The nearby residents either hid in basements or fled to the safety barrier zone. The disaster struck too suddenly; many people were just waking up from pleasant dreams only to find themselves thrust into this horrific reality.</p><p>The students were at school today, originally preparing for their final exams in life magic. Instead of facing intense competition, they encountered such a blood-stained calamity. Students who had been so frightened by demons that they wet their pants the first time seeing them would fare even worse in a city filled with demons. It was indeed difficult to imagine.</p><p>...</p><p>"Investigate and evacuate immediately! This place is extremely unsafe!" Shixu Sheng pounded the table in righteous indignation inside the office.</p><p>Principal Zhu and other school administrators were not present, so the decision fell on Chen Weiliang, the head of the student affairs department. However, Chen Weiliang insisted that the students stay at school, forming a safety line with teachers to resist demon invasion.</p><p>Shixu Sheng did not agree. Although there were many students and teachers, they could not withstand more demons. All the strong mages in Tianlan Magic High School were chasing after demons throughout all of Bo City right now. They had no choice but to rely on themselves.</p><p>"Director, Director, a large group of one-eyed wolf demons is approaching from the backyard. Teacher Lan was... killed," said Teacher Zhou with a pale face.</p><p>The faces of all the teachers in the office changed.</p><p>In fact, even as adult mages, they had never encountered such a disaster. With demons rampaging through the city and attacking anyone they saw, the terrified teachers without much demonic resistance ability trembled with fear.</p><p>"The school has no barrier; if dozens of demons appear at once, we will suffer heavy losses. This is blood-red alert! Under blood-red alert, only the safety barrier offers a chance for survival!" Shixu Sheng roared hysterically.</p><p>Such teachers are teaching magic and turning their students into fools. The Blood Alert has cases, which clearly advise future generations not to attempt to confront demons with one's own strength outside the safety barrier; the survival rate is less than 30%!</p><p>High school freshmen and sophomores were on holiday at home today, while juniors were summoned back to school to prepare for exams and discuss college admissions.</p><p>Fortunately, only the juniors were on campus. These students had undergone trials, encountered demons, and possessed the most solid foundation in magic. If they united, relying on 1,500 students and over a hundred teachers, there was no reason they couldn't reach the safety barrier, which was just 3 kilometers away from their school.</p><p>"Evacuate, evacuate. All head teachers will lead their respective classes, all subject teachers will be evenly distributed to the corresponding classes, and we must collectively reach the safety barrier area," Chen Weiliang finally made his decision.</p><p>There were over a thousand seven hundred people in the school. If the survival rate outside under Blood Alert was only 30%, it meant that more than a thousand would die if they stayed at the school. How terrifying!</p><p>The teachers acted swiftly in such a situation, quickly heading to their classes and gathering all students on the playground for evacuation.</p><p>Less than five minutes after making the decision to evacuate, a gray-faced wind magic teacher ran back to Chen Weiliang, reporting, "Another forty one-eyed wolf demons have appeared in the backyard!"</p><p>"Evacuate immediately! The practical teachers must hold the line no matter what; we absolutely cannot let demons enter the school," Chen Weiliang said with alarm.</p><p>The wind magic teacher looked bitter.</p><p>With fifty-plus one-eyed wolf demons, relying solely on the practical class teachers to stall... how was that possible?</p><p>...</p><p>Xue Musheng hurriedly ran toward his top-class.</p><p>The top-class had the strongest strength. Many students in other classes still couldn't cast spells properly, and while they were said to have the combat power of over a thousand five hundred mages, only a few could actually face demons, with some even unable to cast any magic in front of them.</p><p>As he was about to enter the class, Xue Musheng bumped into a very familiar student, which made him overjoyed. "Mo Fan, why is it you?"</p><p>"I escaped from the hidden chamber of the Sacred Spring. I just happened to be near the school. Mr. Xue, we must evacuate to the safety barrier immediately; otherwise, more people will die. From what I heard from the deputy custodian of the Sacred Spring, this might not even be the peak of the demon attack," Mo Fan panted as he said to Xue Musheng.</p><p>"I agree with you. The evacuation has already been organized," Schu Mingsheng said seriously, nodding.</p><p>"That's perfect. We shouldn't delay any longer; let's leave here right away... I just came down from Qishan Park and saw many one-eyed werewolves in our backyard. I have no idea where they came from," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Really? Then we must evacuate even faster!" Schu Mingsheng exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>To Mo Fan, the current situation seemed far more complex than just a thousand demons invading the city. From his position earlier, he had noticed many demons emerging inexplicably, including not only one-eyed werewolves but also giant-eyed squirrels as well.</p><p>This meant that hiding in the basement was absolutely unsafe. In front of the giant-eyed squirrels, the basement was like their home; they could dig them out and eat them at any moment!</p><p>Back when they first encountered demons, how many people fainted in fear.</p><p>Now, hundreds of demons roamed their city, leaving corpses and pools of blood behind. Hardly anyone remained calm; there were already quite a few girls crying.</p><p>For students, everything happened too suddenly and was too terrifying, even to the point where they didn't know what had happened to their own families.</p><p>Seeing the entire class immersed in fear and despair reminded Mo Fan of natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons in his original world. In front of nature, humans really were insignificant, and faced with a horde of demons, humanity was equally helpless.</p><p>"Ughhh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!"</p><p>A sudden roar came from the basketball court at the foot of the hill. Students sitting near the window looked down and were horrified to see a one-eyed werewolf leap down from the slope, its agile body slamming onto the basketball hoop.</p><p>The entire basketball hoop was forcibly crushed to the ground, shattering instantly, while the one-eyed werewolf slowly lifted its fiery eyes, greedily staring at the delicious students in the classroom.</p><p>Hunger and gluttony were all they saw in those eyes; screams of horror erupted from the building!!</p><p>"Demon... Demon... Demons!!??" The usually diligent boy near the window said with a pale face.</p><p>Compared to the previous ghost wolves, this one-eyed werewolf was even more malevolent. Just looking at it made him feel his scalp tingle.</p>
