						<p>Fan Mo, step back; this beast is ours to handle!" Captain Xu Dahang and Fat Shi arrived simultaneously.</p><p>The two of them moved as if they were on a level elevator on an accelerated moving walkway; their feet didn’t even touch the ground, yet their bodies glided along it, akin to the high monk in Food God!</p><p>Mo Fan knew this was Earth Elemental’s basic skill—Earthwave!</p><p>Earthwave was a teleportation skill that allowed rapid positional changes by controlling the movement of the ground. Wang Sanpang could also use this move, but he wasn’t nearly as proficient as Fat Shi.</p><p>"This is a Giga Eye Ratsnake, long living in soil, an expert at digging tunnels, and preferring to reside in inaccessible places like city sewers. It can extend its neck and emit a penetrative dark red light beam… This creature breeds rapidly and has strong survival skills; several of them are likely hiding in the underground passages and garbage dumps of any city. They usually feed on human leftovers but may turn to eating people if they’re severely hungry. They belong to the type of demons that are both cunning and omnipresent!" Deputy Captain Guo Caitang quickly provided information about the monster.</p><p>Giga Eye Ratsnake??</p><p>We studied this in Demonology class for several sessions; it’s an expert at surviving underground and digging holes, a Blue Dragon among demons!</p><p>They say these things might urinate and run away when they encounter a mage. Why is this guy daring to attack me!?</p><p>"This one seems very agitated; it must be extremely hungry, needing large amounts of food and energy. We were lucky to find it!" Fat Shi said with a grin.</p><p>Unlike the students who had been petrified upon first encountering demons, Captain Xu Dahang, Little Ke, Wind Mage Li Wenjie, Deputy Captain Guo Caitang, and Uncle Fat Shi all approached the Giga Eye Ratsnake in a completely different manner.</p><p>They stood in a loose formation while maintaining distances that allowed for mutual support.</p><p>They were ready to attack but could quickly retreat if danger threatened.</p><p>Only Mo Fan, the newly joined member, found himself in an awkward position. It seemed he had told his teammates "Step back, I’ll take on this beast alone," but in reality, he was inching behind them, silently cursing Fat Shi for not giving him an Earthwave.</p><p>"Guruguru~~~~~~~~~~~!"</p><p>The Giga Eye Ratsnake was indeed very agitated; instead of fleeing upon seeing the crowd, it immediately locked its eye onto the nearest Wind Mage, Li Wenjie.</p><p>It emitted a dark red light beam, this creature from the dark corners of human cities seemingly intent on piercing everything that moved. Its sharp cries pierced through the night campus air with particular force.</p><p>"Want to attack me?" The Wind Mage Li Wenjie exuded a calm and suave demeanor.</p><p>Mo Fan barely saw Li Wenjie deliberately focus on connecting the star paths before a streak of blue wind currents appeared around him, causing his white shirt to flutter uncontrollably.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A crimson piercing light shot towards them, but Li Wenjie left behind a chaotic whirlwind in its place. His figure had already darted five meters away—how could one describe his suave and charismatic demeanor?</p><p>"Fool, you dare come out to harm people with such pitiful abilities!" Li Wenjie paused briefly at the ping pong table before turning to the giant-eyed gerbil with a sneer.</p><p>Seeing that his beam of light was ineffective against this agile human, the giant-eyed gerbil became furious and began moving its sharp limbs.</p><p>Despite its strangely shaped neck and head, the giant-eyed gerbil's speed surpassed that of the dark wolves Mo Fan had previously encountered. Charging towards the students at such speed, even if they managed to calmly complete their star paths, it would likely be too late for them to release them!</p><p>The students typically needed about four seconds to release their abilities, yet this giant-eyed gerbil closed the 40-meter gap to Li Wenjie's position in just two seconds. Its sharp claws then swiped at Li Wenjie's face.</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but feel alarmed, fearing that Li Wenjie might be killed.</p><p>Looking around, neither Water-type Xiao Ke nor Earth-type Fat Shi showed any intention of coming to Li Wenjie's rescue.</p><p>"Wind Path · Flash Step!" Li Wenjie's eyes were completely unfazed, his gaze eerily calm as he stared at the charging giant-eyed gerbil. He coldly uttered the skill name.</p><p>"Whoosh~~!"</p><p>Li Wenjie vanished from his original spot once more. The giant-eyed gerbil's claw struck the stone ping pong table, sending fragments flying everywhere.</p><p>Upon realizing that its attack had missed, this beast immediately began searching for Li Wenjie again.</p><p>"Whoosh~~~!"</p><p>Taking a step, Li Wenjie left behind another cloud of dust before swiftly vanishing twenty meters away.</p><p>"Whoosh~~~!!"</p><p>Li Wenjie paused briefly under a cottonwood tree and suddenly, he quickly drifted out of Mo Fan's line of sight once more.</p><p>Immediately after, a vicious red beam struck the cottonwood tree where Li Wenjie had just stopped. The tree was completely penetrated, and its cottonwood flowers fell in droves, like used sanitary pads thrown into a trash bin.</p><p>Wind Pathway: Flash Step!!</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but marvel at it.</p><p>In school, all wind students mastered Wind Pathway: Swift Run, which allowed them to sprint at incredible speeds along the traceable air channels they created. While swift and agile, their movements lacked the rapid directional changes that Li Wenjie demonstrated with his Wind Pathway: Flash Step!</p><p>If Zhang Xiaohou had known Wind Pathway: Flash Step back then, he could have easily outmaneuvered the Shadow Wolf Beast, avoiding its relentless pursuit to the bottom of the cave.</p><p>Though both were basic skills—Wind Pathways—the effects were clearly on different levels. The Giant-Eyed Rat's agility surpassed even that of the Shadow Wolf Beast, barely brushing against Li Wenjie's hem.</p><p>Indeed, what one learns in school is too limited. Only through such environments and continuous battles can one truly enhance their capabilities.</p><p>Choosing to hunt demons was undoubtedly a wise decision. Only by following these fearless hunters could Mo Fan grow rapidly; those who panicked at the sight of demons had no future!</p><p>This wasn't due to any resentment towards his classmates but rather a realization that struck him after battling the Shadow Wolf Beast.</p><p>Chasing rankings, chasing scores, shooting targets, attending demonology classes, analyzing combat techniques—none of these were useful when faced with actual demons. Only through constant battles and encounters with real demons could one improve.</p><p>"Try the taste of fire!"</p><p>Captain Xu Dahuang's confidence was evident as a ball of flame rose between his palms, burning fiercely, casting a red glow on this imposing man's upturned lips filled with disdain!</p>
