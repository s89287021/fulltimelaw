						<p>Ten days later, under the lush canopy of the forest, a winding mountain path led to a cliffside where a group of twenty students in their Tianlan Magic High School uniforms stood. </p><p>No matter how they complained or expressed dissatisfaction, they ultimately set off on the reward training journey. </p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten full days had passed. </p><p>Over these ten days, they hacked through thorny thickets and braved starlight and moonlit nights as they trekked through mountains and forests, enduring immense hardship. </p><p>"That damned chief instructor, may his true nature be cursed; he exiled us to this godforsaken place," Wang Sanpang panted, sitting down heavily on the ground and fanning himself with his cap.</p><p>"Yes, what kind of wind are you blowing? Speaking of which, how come we're not there yet after 30 kilometers? Is today our tenth day?" Zhang Shuhua, with a neck like that of a giraffe, asked.</p><p>"Those 30 kilometers are a straight-line distance. We have to climb mountains, cross valleys, and navigate around peaks; the total journey is far more than just 30 kilometers," Zhang Xiaohou said.</p><p>Mo Fan's group consisted of twenty people in total. This training mission was entirely undertaken by the students themselves, without any teachers or instructors accompanying them. They were given only a map to guide their way.</p><p>These days of climbing over mountains and crossing valleys had turned everyone into primitives, dirty and drenched with sweat!</p><p>"Once we cross this river valley, we should be close to Chief Instructor's mentioned Hundred Herbs Valley," the class monitor Zhou Min said, holding up the map.</p><p>"What the hell, how are we supposed to cross this river valley? Are we going to fly over it? It’s at least 10 meters wide!" Wang Sanpang was the first to speak up.</p><p>Right before them lay a cliffside river valley!</p><p>The opposite cliff face loomed close, but the raging rapids below were terrifying to behold. The roar of the water crashing against the rocks could be clearly heard!</p><p>"What can we do? We can't just give up halfway."</p><p>"Maybe we should head back, after all, there are other groups. Maybe they can finish it…" Zhang Shuhua said.</p><p>"You, you have no backbone! Why rely on others!" Zhou Min immediately scolded him.</p><p>"Well, what else can we do? None of us can cross this cliff and ravine."</p><p>"Oh right, Zhang Yinglu, aren't you a Wind Mage? Try to jump over it!"</p><p>At that moment, Xu Shaoting glanced at a girl with a ponytail beside them.</p><p>The girl named Zhang Yinglu's face turned pale as she timidly said, "N-no, don't make me. I won't jump. What if I fall?"</p><p>"We have ropes. There are trees on both sides of the cliff. As long as someone can directly jump to the other side of the ravine and tie the rope to a tree there, we can all climb over using the rope," Zhou Min said with her eyes brightening.</p><p>"Zhang Yinglu, don't you want to get an A? You'll be jumping with a rope tied. Even if you don't make it across, we can catch you. It's just like bungee jumping."</p><p>Xu Shaoting continued.</p><p>"I don't want to!!" Zhang Yinglu was clearly a timid girl.</p><p>"F*ck, you're a Wind Mage and don't step up when needed. What are you even doing as a mage?" Another Water Mage also said.</p><p>"Maybe we shouldn't push her too far," Zhou Min said.</p><p>When everyone didn't know what to do, Mo Fan glanced at Zhang Xiaohou beside him.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou wasn't particularly outstanding in the advanced class, so they usually put their hopes on Zhang Yinglu, who had the best Wind Magic grades. However, Zhang Yinglu was just a girl and wouldn't dare do such a dangerous thing.</p><p>"Monkey, are you up for it?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"What have I got to lose!" Zhang Xiaohou patted his chest.</p><p>"All right!"</p><p>Zhang Xiao Hou stepped forward and said to Zhou Min, Xu Zhao Ting, Zhang Shuhua, and other class leaders: "Tie the rope around me. I'll do it."</p><p>Zhang Shuhua and Xu Zhao Ting both looked skeptical, sizing up Zhang Xiao Hou, who did not stand out particularly in their top-class.</p><p>However, having someone step forward was better than just standing there anxiously.</p><p>Zhou Min was relatively quick, and soon tied one end of the rope around Zhang Xiao Hou's waist.</p><p>"Step back, everyone. Make way for Zhang Xiao Hou to get a running start."</p><p>Others immediately gave Zhang Xiao Hou a thumbs up. Many people standing at the cliff's edge were shaking from the strong wind, who had the courage to jump?</p><p>"Monkey, don't worry. If I can't make it across, I'll pull you back," Mo Fan tied the other end of the rope to a tree trunk on their side and grabbed the rope tightly with both hands!</p><p>Zhang Xiao Hou gave Mo Fan a hearty smile.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Zhang Xiao Hou slowly closed his eyes, whether to connect with star tracks or to steel himself, no one knew!</p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Xiao Hou opened his eyes, and a green glow shone in his pupils.</p><p>A sudden strong wind whipped around Zhang Xiao Hou!</p><p>Under Zhang Xiao Hou's mental control, the wind transformed into a wind track leading from halfway up the slope to the edge of the cliff.</p><p>The track was invisible, but the dust it kicked up made it clear that it was like a special wind passage!</p><p>"Wind Track? Sprint!"</p><p>Zhang Xiao Hou shouted, and the star tracks swirling around him glowed at their brightest.</p><p>"Whoosh~"</p><p>A gust of wind, his clothes rustling! Zhang Xiaohou's body transformed into a blurry shadow and swiftly passed through the wind trail he had created. He raced through this wind trail, his speed increasing rapidly!</p><p>The hillside was no obstacle to Zhang Xiaohou. As he galloped wildly, he parted the grass beneath him like waves, charging toward the cliff's edge!</p><p>"Jump! Jump quickly!!"</p><p>Xu Shaoting, Zhou Min, and Zhang Shuhua all stared intently at Zhang Xiaohou. The wind element girl, Zhang Yinglu, who dared not jump, widened her eyes even further!</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou reached the cliff's edge, forcefully stamping his right foot, shattering a piece of rock by the cliffside while leaping into the air!</p><p>"Ahooooooo～～～～～～～"</p><p>In mid-air, Zhang Xiaohou faced the howling wind above the valley, his face distorted by the force.</p><p>His body drew an arc between the cliffs, gradually approaching another cliff.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan clenched the rope tightly. If Zhang Xiaohou's leap fell short, he must pull him back; otherwise, he might collide with some jagged rocks below the cliff!</p><p>The remaining 19 people all looked up at Zhang Xiaohou as he leaped across the cliffs, their hearts hanging in suspense.</p><p>Finally, Zhang Xiaohou landed.</p><p>His feet slammed heavily onto the edge of the other cliff, and his body rolled forward continuously.</p><p>"Crash!!"</p><p>In the end, after several rolls, he still collided with a large tree on the opposite cliff, leaving everyone on the other side stunned.</p><p>Turning from his squinting position, he immediately grinned broadly at the 19 people on the other side of the cliff, creating a very amusing scene.</p><p>Although his appearance was comical, Zhang Xiaohou's image suddenly gained a few more points in the eyes of his classmates.</p><p>Out of the 20 people, there were about four Wind users, but only Zhang Xiaohou dared to jump over.</p><p>What could the other few good Wind users do at this moment?</p><p>"Monkey, well done!!" Mo Fan was the first to call out.</p><p>Zhou Min, Zhang Shuhua, Wang Sanpang, and others also raised their thumbs towards Zhang Xiaohou.</p><p>"Let's go!" Xu Zhao ting was the first to climb over the rope.</p><p>The remaining 19 people successfully crossed this river valley cliff, completing the first major test of this ordeal. They had reached the destination, Hundred Herbs Valley!</p>
