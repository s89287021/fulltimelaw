						<p>Returning to his residence, Mo Fan discovered Xinxia quietly sitting on the small balcony, with her eyes closed, presumably diligently meditating. She planned to directly take the magic college entrance exam next year, and there was still a lot she needed to learn. Mo Fan wanted to share his inner joy with Xinxia, but seeing her solemn and dignified appearance, he did not want to disturb her. On second thought, it would be better not to say anything now and give this girl a big surprise later. It was afternoon, and the bright sunlight resembled delicate white gossamer draping gently over Xinxia's delicate figure. In her poised and graceful posture, Xinxia slightly tilted her rosy lips upward, like a girl in a beautiful dream. It seemed that she had made considerable progress in her cultivation; given her indifferent attitude toward everything, it was unlikely for her to exhibit such excitement easily. Mo Fan stood silently beside her, watching quietly. Her raven-black hair framed her small and clean face. Although Xinxia did not have a perfect almond-shaped face, her cheeks would pout slightly when she pursed her little mouth, making her even more adorable. Once she closed her beautiful eyes, the curved lashes made her appear even more pitiable. Such a girl often evoked no lascivious thoughts; the weakness brought by the wheelchair only added to one's desire to protect her. On that night of the disaster in Bocity, Mo Fan had told her that if she couldn't walk, he would give her a pair of wings. Winged creatures existed. However, their high price was something ordinary people could never afford in several lifetimes. For Mo Fan, realizing this wish used to seem out of reach, but now… with his boundless potential, he would only become stronger and richer, eventually giving her beautiful wings with his own hands. Unable to experience the freedom of running, he would relish the sensation of wind at his ears and clouds beneath his feet. Mo Fan never woke Xinxia up. He knew what he had to do; the joy brought by awakening both elements did not cool down but transformed into boundless anticipation and desire for the future, confidence in being able to control everything, and burning passion within him!</p><p>Returned to his room, Mo Fan did not want to waste a moment.</p><p>Four whole elemental systems; awakening them did not mean he would become strong. It merely meant that the more effort he put in, the greater his potential for improvement.</p><p>He would need to spend more time on cultivation, practice controlling more different elemental stars, and consume more resources.</p><p>Fortunately, Little Mudskipper provided Mo Fan with tremendous assistance.</p><p>Actually, many people could not even cultivate a single magic element to mastery, let alone have time to meditate on others. For Mo Fan, who needed to cultivate four elements, time would certainly be insufficient if he wanted to improve all of them.</p><p>However, the warmth that Little Mudskipper fell into allowed Mo Fan to meditate for twenty-four hours a day without tiring.</p><p>Mo Fan decided to lock himself in his room and squeeze every moment out of the day.</p><p>The warmth from the Earth Saint Spring had been absorbed by Little Mudskipper. Although it could not achieve the direct effects of the Earth Saint Spring, it increased Mo Fan's meditation speed by about two times!</p><p>Ordinary-grade stardust magic artifacts increased cultivation speed by around 20%.</p><p>Spirit-grade stardust magic artifacts increased cultivation speed by around 40%.</p><p>Absorbing the warmth from the Earth Saint Spring, Little Mudskipper underwent another transformation and upgrade. Mo Fan could no longer determine its grade, but whenever he entered meditation, he could feel the doubled effectiveness brought by Little Mudskipper's warmth.</p><p>A two-fold increase!</p><p>This was a hard increase in warmth, not counting Mo Fan's own understanding of cultivation or his extended meditation sessions. Even when Mo Fan was not meditating, Little Mudskipper's nourishment effect continued to exist, gradually boosting his cultivation level.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Fan now had a completely reasonable allocation of time.</p><p>It had been about three months when Mo Fan was pleasantly surprised to discover that his Shadow System Stardust had grown to the level it had taken him a whole year to reach back then! The improvement of Shadow System Stardust was like riding on a rocket, and Mo Fan himself couldn’t believe it.</p><p>"It should be because after reaching the intermediate Mage level, Stardust has become very familiar to Mages who possess Nebulae. Therefore, the speed of improvement will be much faster than before." Mo Fan thought to himself.</p><p>By evenly distributing his cultivation time across all systems, Mo Fan didn’t have an advantage over others.</p><p>Theoretically, given three months of cultivation time under this 2.5 times buff, it should be at most equivalent to cultivating for half a year in the past. However, he had achieved the level of one whole year! If he were to take this performance in the annual assessment, getting an S would not be a problem!</p><p>After much thought, Mo Fan felt that the only explanation was that his own meditation efficiency had improved by about 1.5 times compared to before!</p><p>Because he had to take care of his Fire System and Lightning System at Nebula level every day, it made dealing with Shadow System Stardust and Summoning System Stardust much more natural.</p><p>It felt like a father who had raised two troublesome children from infants to their teens would easily handle the arrival of another couple of kids, managing them effortlessly and getting them to cooperate smoothly!</p><p>The Shadow System Stardust and Summoning System Stardust were already at the level where they could be released. Only then did Mo Fan start communicating with the Shadow System Star.</p><p>Similarly, Mo Fan had long been very proficient with Star Tracks. Even though he had to rebuild trust with the Shadow System Star and Summoning System Star from scratch, using his old tricks of coaxing and deceiving, even the most stubborn stars would eventually obey.</p><p>Cultivating the Shadow System and Summoning System was much smoother compared to when he first cultivated the Lightning and Fire Systems. He didn’t take any detours and wouldn’t lose confidence due to failures.</p><p>Mo Fan had already practiced controlling the stars. Under normal circumstances, someone who just connected seven stars would be eager to use new skills and spend most of their time practicing complete releases. Considering the limited time, Mo Fan resisted this impulse and focused on building solid fundamentals.</p><p>At university, there was plenty of time and space for practice. In this remote settlement, there weren’t many attractive girls with good figures that he could sneak a peek at using Shadow Concealment.</p>
