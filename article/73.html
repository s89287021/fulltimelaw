						<p>Time flies, and Mo Fan has devoted this precious youth to cultivation and monster hunting, deriving great pleasure from it.

With his unwavering support from the people, he has helped many grassroots magicians rise to prominence and discovered countless talented individuals with no notable background.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun, on the other hand, embodies the power and influence of typical magical families and aristocratic houses, specializing in nurturing children from wealthy backgrounds into formidable magicians. His family's young magicians are celebrated for their exceptional abilities, often outshining students from public schools like Tianlan Magic High School.</p><p>Occasionally, conflicts arise between grassroots magicians and aristocratic magicians, with Mu Zhuoyun’s family being a common point of contention. Every year, the highlight of his celebrations is when his young magicians decisively defeat students from public schools in magical duels, leaving Principal Zhu to watch helplessly as they gloat over their victories.</p><p>Deng Kai and Principal Zhu are Mo Fan's staunch allies, always standing with him in any conflict. Even if Mo Fan hadn’t provoked a duel with Mu’s younger generation, they would have intervened to calm the situation when he cursed Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>A student who received three S's in the annual evaluation is truly a treasure to their school. How can someone like Mu Zhuoyun, who acts like an emperor, suppress them? Upon hearing that Mo Fan had exceptionally killed a rampaging summoning beast during his important training, Principal Zhu and Deng Kai felt as if they had found a precious gem. Mo Fan may not have been aware that both Principal Zhu and Deng Kai had always shown great interest in him, but these two old magicians of Bo City, whose primary goal was to cultivate grassroots mages, had always sent people to take care of him with concern. However, schools are schools; they can't hold too many personal biases. They also wished that the Stardust Magic Tool could be available for Mo Fan at all times, but alas, they couldn't favor one student over others like a noble family! ... Just as Yu Ang's coming-of-age ceremony was being arranged like a major festival in Bo City, Principal Zhu and Deng Kai finally summoned Mo Fan to the principal's office. Deng Kai had seen Mo Fan before; he was the one who stood up for him back then, a grand elder of the Bo City Hunter Alliance with strength surpassing that of the mid-ranked mage named Yang Zuohé. Principal Zhu had met Mo Fan for the first time. This highly respected principal in the hearts of students and parents had a semi-reclusive nature, but he would still come out to take charge of major matters. "Mo Fan, there are some things we need to speak about seriously with you," Deng Kai began. Mo Fan stood there, listening attentively. "In fact, every so often, students from Tianlan Magic High School and disciples from noble families have a sparring match. In the past, we would select the most outstanding student with the strongest combat skills among all students to face off against the young nobles of Bo City... Initially, our hope was placed on Xu Zhao ting, as he is a rare lightning mage and has a better chance of winning in this competition. However, you emerged with excellent results in the annual evaluation and boldly challenged the noble families. To prevent Mu Zhuoyun from finding ways to make your life difficult, we deliberately steered the matter towards this sparring match that was already scheduled to take place," Deng Kai said seriously to Mo Fan. "I know... Oh, my meaning is, thank you two principals for helping me out of a jam," Mo Fan replied. "To be honest, we've been protecting you for two years now. We have an idea of how much you've grown during this time, so you will ultimately have to pay the price for your recklessness back then," Deng Kai said helplessly, shaking his head. Deng Kai had already gathered some information from others; Yu Ang's cultivation had surged dramatically in these two years, and with the combat drills provided by his family, Mo Fan might not be his match even if he were as clever as ever. Everyone knew that killing the summoning beast back then was partly due to luck. "Ah, Mr. Mo Fan, we all know that heaven is sometimes unfair, giving some people inherent privileges while others have nothing at all. However, this doesn't mean you can blame heaven or vent your frustrations rashly. You may have expressed dissatisfaction towards those superior individuals that day, and many people do the same, but it also means you are pushing yourself to the brink of a abyss. When your strength is far from enough to contend with an entire family, holding back your anger isn't necessarily a bad thing," Principal Zhu said solemnly. As principal for so many years, Principal Zhu had seen too many students with pride in their hearts; some indeed achieved greatness and became revered mages, while others fell into oblivion, never to be heard from again.</p><p>Talent is important, cultivation is important, but what matters most is judging the times and circumstances. Don’t do meaningless things. The protection school can provide is only for a few years. Once you enter society, it will still be those in power who have the say.</p><p>"Thank you both principals for your guidance. At that time, I was indeed being reckless," Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>"We called you here today not entirely for education… we also hope that you can win this decisive battle, because the victor will get the unique opportunity to cultivate at the Earth Holy Spring in Bog City," Principal Zhu continued.</p><p>"Earth Holy Spring??" Mo Fan’s eyes lit up instantly.</p>
