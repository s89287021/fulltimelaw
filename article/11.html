						<p>With a cheerful mood, humming "Little Apple," Mo Fan headed towards Mingwen Girls' School.</p><p>Mingwen Girls' School is an all-girls private high school, where the most delicate and fashionable young ladies of Xia City gather.</p><p>Different from other schools, there was no dull magical theory education here; nor were there groups of students who only knew how to take exams. These girls, many with family backgrounds in magic, knew much more than those who had come out of the nine-year compulsory magical education, such as magic items and accessories imbued with magical power that often hung around their necks.</p><p>Compared to these second-generation mages and heirs, who were born wearing spirit-nourishing magic items, Mo Fan, this ordinary silk, naturally had to climb step by step.</p><p>The lanes surrounding the campus were filled with luxurious carriages. It was peak dismissal time, and Mo Fan knew Xin Ye's personality well—she would avoid these girls comparing their carriage levels and take her own narrow alleyway, smelling the faint fragrance of the small bamboo planted on the windowsills by the residents...</p><p>Mo Fan detoured around the main gate, planning to intercept... uh, wait for this neighborly younger sister, Xin Ye.</p><p>Few people walked down this alley. Mo Fan crossed through someone else's yard and stepped into this familiar alleyway.</p><p>The world had changed, but this familiar city remained unchanged. The small bamboo that had endured the winter still stood on the windowsills of the residents.</p><p>It occurred to him that Xin Ye probably hadn't changed either.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan stood in the middle of the alley, leaning against the wall like a petty hoodlum waiting for an opportunity to rob passing elementary school students' game coins. He kept glancing at the alley entrance, hoping to surprise the girl walking towards him soon. However, after a long time, that graceful figure still hadn't appeared.</p><p>Why hasn't she come yet?</p><p>Mo Fan's pose was starting to feel a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Closing his eyes slightly, Mo Fan almost instinctively began meditating...</p><p>Suddenly, he sensed some noisy sounds coming from the direction of the small mountain leading out of the alley. These noises would normally be blocked by the high walls of the alley, but for some reason, they reached his ears...</p><p>Is it possible that the side effect of meditation is an enhancement in perceptual abilities??</p><p>Curious, Mo Fan headed towards the direction of the small hill.</p><p>As soon as he stepped out of the alley, the view of the small hill in front of him suddenly opened up. In reality, the mountain directly opposite was about a kilometer away, and at its foot lay his old house that he had just sold not long ago.</p><p>The swing hung straight down without any movement.</p><p>A black waterfall of hair draped over a young girl sitting on the stationary swing. The winter wind messed up her hair, revealing a pale and plump elegant profile, long eyelashes, a delicate nose bridge, rosy lips...</p><p>She stared ahead, as calm as a fragile lotus blooming uniquely in this winter swing painting, pitiful yet radiating her own unique charm and fragrance.</p><p>Mo Fan suddenly stopped walking. He didn't know when he had started to enjoy quietly watching her, watching her sit still somewhere, feeling an inexplicable warm current surge within him, flowing down to his heart, then involuntarily lifting the corners of his mouth.</p><p>However, after a moment, Mo Fan felt something was amiss.</p><p>His brows furrowed immediately, and he hurried towards the elegant young girl on the swing.</p><p>The girl sensed someone approaching. When she recognized Mo Fan's face, there was no trace of surprise on her face; instead, she smiled gracefully as if she had known this person would come and had merely been waiting for him here.</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan," the girl called sweetly.</p><p>"It's those damn things again, isn't it?" Mo Fan approached, his face faintly radiating anger.</p><p>Xin Xia remained silent.</p><p>"I'm going to teach them a lesson today, that bunch of scum!!" Mo Fan was boiling with rage as he looked towards the staircase on top of the hill.</p><p>"There are too many of them; forget about it," Xin Xia shook her head, trying to persuade Mo Fan to calm down.</p><p>"It's not over just like that, I'm not done with these scum." Mo Fan didn't say anything more and climbed up the staircase!</p><p>Xin Xia, sitting on Qian Qiu, wanted to hold Mo Fan back, but Mo Fan had already stormed off towards the mountain with his hair standing on end in anger.</p><p>Xin Xia knew Mo Fan's temper; she had been constantly fighting small thugs and hoodlums over her own affairs since an early age. Each time, he would return home beaten up after taking on several opponents...</p><p>This was exactly what she didn't want to see.</p><p>There were at least five of them over there, two of whom were strong and much bigger than Mo Fan. If he went up to confront them, he would surely come back with a bruised face and nose.</p><p>...</p><p>Hilltop Pavilion</p><p>"I say, Xu Bing, won't we look ungentlemanly doing this..." said a young man who had a cigarette in his mouth and was holding a deck of cards.</p><p>"How can it be ungentlemanly? I've sincerely proposed to her for the sixteenth time, asking her to be my girlfriend... Now I'm playing cards in this pavilion, giving her some time to think. What's the problem?" said Xu Bing, the young man.</p><p>Xu Bing had a clear blue tattoo around half of his neck that was very noticeable due to his short jacket, indicating he was someone not to be messed with.</p><p>"That's right, if she rejects me, I could just leave... Four deuces! Hahaha, bet more money, double or nothing!" said the young man in ripped denim jeans sitting on the other side.</p><p>"Damn it, you lucky ****."</p><p>"Let's play a few more rounds, a few more rounds. Play until dark, and she'll panic," Xu Bing squinted his eyes, enjoying the feeling of being an overbearing boss.</p><p>Dealing with women meant being tough; they were naturally shy, and without toughness, nothing could be accomplished. That girl, Xin Xia, had grown even prettier and more beautiful, making people drool just by looking at her. Someone even said that he was a toad wanting to eat swan meat. Today, he would take this girl down, and no one would dare say another word.</p><p>"Oh right, I remember the little girl has an older brother who's pretty annoying," said the young man in denim jeans.</p><p>"Fighters with combat power below five are nothing but trash, possessing only a bit of dignity and serving as human punching bags to be beaten up at will," Xu Bing said nonchalantly.</p><p>"Somebody else can take care of him now. I've built some muscle and could easily destroy that thing in a minute!"</p>
