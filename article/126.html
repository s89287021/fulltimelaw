						<p>Fireblood Species???</p><p>A million question marks popped into Mo Fan's mind.</p><p>This concept doesn't seem to have been mentioned in school, does it?</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but turn his gaze towards Ms. Tang Yue, who was actually very close by.</p><p>Ms. Tang Yue had a very exquisite and standard almond-shaped face, bright and electric eyes, a high and sexy nose bridge, a rosy and enchanting small mouth, and her skin was fair and lustrous. At such a close distance, one couldn't find any flaws at all.</p><p>Ms. Tang Yue also noticed Mo Fan's lecherous look and glared at him fiercely, saying, "Blaspheming teachers used to be beaten to death!"</p><p>"Sister Tang Yue, please take a good look; it's you pinning me down! Seducing students used to mean being put in a hog pen!"</p><p>When Ms. Tang Yue saw that group of people leave, she finally let go of Mo Fan.</p><p>The second Ms. Tang Yue let go of Mo Fan, their figures reappeared behind the tree, looking very strange.</p><p>Ms. Tang Yue was too lazy to engage in wordplay with Mo Fan. She knew that Mo Fan definitely didn't understand what Fireblood Species meant and started her lesson as a teacher: "The universe nurtures elements, and these elements have different ranks based on their growth environment. Some special places, due to the high activity of this element, produce fire seeds imbued with spirit. If such fire seeds are refined and absorbed by a Fire Mage, the power of that Fire Mage's fire spells will be greatly enhanced!"</p><p>Greatly enhanced?</p><p>Mo Fan was thrilled when he heard this.</p><p>Mo Fan had long noticed that regardless of one's cultivation level, the power of their spells was more or less the same.</p><p>Like now, he was at least an intermediate Mage, but his initial spells were only much faster than a beginner's; in terms of power, they were still the same as those of a beginner Mage.</p><p>The Fire Surge·Explosion Xu Dahan cast and the one Mo Fan cast now didn't have much difference. This point troubled Mo Fan greatly. In fantasy novels he used to read, everyone else's skills' power increased synchronously with their cultivation level, didn't it!</p><p>Mo Fan thought that the power of his skills would never be able to increase, but who knew the improvement would come from here!</p><p>Fire Elemental Spirit!</p><p>Currently, Mo Fan’s mana reserve is not stardust but star clouds. For Mo Fan, casting several low-level spells might not deplete his mana, although mid-level spells are indeed powerful. However, it would be too wasteful to use big spells on small enemies, and the noise would be huge!</p><p>Moreover, while low-level spells lack the power of mid-level ones, their effects are still substantial. For example, the muscle paralysis effect of lightning spells is very practical in any battle.</p><p>"The most common fire elemental spirit can fetch up to twenty million in the market, often requiring bidding wars. I wonder why this desperado dared to venture out and wander around; it turns out he was lured by the fire elemental spirit," Teacher Tang Yue’s eyes sparkled with understanding as her rosy lips curved into a smile.</p><p>"T-wen-tong wan... my goodness, that could buy a mansion in Shanghai!" Mo Fan couldn’t help but gasp. This elemental spirit must be more expensive than diamonds!</p><p>"Sorry, can’t afford it!" Tang Yue gave Mo Fan a disdainful look.</p><p>Well, maybe Shanghai’s real estate prices were even more absurd.</p><p>Nevertheless, the value of such a small fire elemental spirit being so high was already quite surprising to Mo Fan.</p><p>Moreover, this thing directly boosts the power of fire spells. Not only do low-level spells see exponential increases in power, but mid-level spells do as well...</p><p>Think about the unreasonable power of Flame Fist. If that Flame Giant Fist’s power doubled again, not only would servant-grade demons be killed instantly, even general-grade demons might struggle to survive??</p><p>"Oh right, I remember Mu Ningxue seemed to have been born with something special..." Mo Fan suddenly remembered and asked anxiously.</p><p>Mo Fan had only arrived here recently, so he needed to catch up on a lot of knowledge.</p><p>"Yes, besides the special elemental seeds nurtured in the world, certain families might have individuals who are naturally endowed with an elemental spirit. Such people usually awaken several years earlier than ordinary folks and possess skills of their attribute twice as strong or even more... Mu Ningxue is likely born with a Crystal Ice Spirit, the strongest ice-type spirit in Spiritual-grade ice spirits, which is 2.5 times stronger than Common-grade ones. She can freeze everyone in an area within two seconds by casting Ice Vine · Coverage, making it highly effective against groups of demons. Combining this with Earth Wave to slow down the movement of demon groups could freeze several demons," Teacher Tang Yue patiently explained to Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan’s mouth gaped open.</p><p>No wonder Old Devil Mu Zhuoyun treated Mu Ningxue like a treasure, and the entire Capital City referred to her as the First Female Genius. With 2.5 times the power from birth, she truly outshines peers of her age. Moreover, she awakens several years earlier than average people, giving her an overwhelming advantage, which is why she was directly admitted to the Imperial Academy.</p><p>"Indeed, grassroots have no way out." Mo Fan muttered.</p><p>"With Teacher Tang Yue saying this, my mind feels a lot more balanced."</p><p>"There are downsides too; since you spend much more time and resources cultivating at the same level compared to others, your cultivation won't improve without enough resources. In short, it's all about burning money and resources."</p><p>Mo Fan twitched his lips.</p><p>Teacher Tang, if you don't pile on more criticism, we could still have a pleasant teacher-student relationship.</p><p>Mo Fan indeed experienced this firsthand; while others bought Star Marks for no more than 50,000, he had to buy two— one Fire and one Lightning—and that alone cost him 100,000!</p><p>Moreover, take this spirit seed as an example; not only did he need to obtain a Fire spirit seed, but it seemed he also needed a Lightning one... If a Fire spirit seed cost twenty million, how much would a Lightning one cost.</p><p>Damn, this was the lifestyle of living in the suburbs for life!</p><p>(%!(EXTRA string=english, string=english))</p>
