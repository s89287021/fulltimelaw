						<p>Xu Dahang also wanted to intervene and save him, but they were simply too far away from him. His powerful punches could never reach them.</p><p>Moreover, there were demons all around Xu Dahang and his companion. It was uncertain whether they could survive at all.</p><p>After completing this strike, Mo Fan picked up Xin Xia and hurriedly evacuated the building. The demons were not blind; even mid-level mages would not let them disrupt their plans so boldly.</p><p>Mid-level mages were powerful and had complete skills that could instantly kill them, but there were too many demons. Their demon sea tactics could also eliminate a human mid-level mage. If it came to that, they could call on their leader, the War General-class demons, who would never fear human mid-level mages!</p><p>...</p><p>Sure enough, not long after Mo Fan intervened, the building was surrounded by several dozen demons, and even more were gathering there.</p><p>Fortunately, Mo Fan and Xin Xia moved quickly. Otherwise, he would have saved them but lost his own life. Mo Fan now only had one Book of Star Maps left. Unless all those dozens of demons stood in a circle for him to punch at once, one mid-level magic spell could not destroy them all.</p><p>Mo Fan saw that things were going south and fled quickly.</p><p>Soon, Mo Fan arrived at the James Highway Bridge, where the military's Darkstone motorcycles were parked. As long as he did not encounter War General-class demons, he could basically return to camp safely.</p><p>The night grew deeper, with howling winds whistling past his ears. The black Vormo almost blended into the eerie scenery.</p><p>From the James Highway Bridge, it was easy to see the city of Bohem shrouded in darkness. Occasionally, bright magical lights would illuminate certain streets, and sometimes roars would come from some floors below... In the decades of peace, who could have thought that such a disaster would befall a city? Or perhaps this world was never truly peaceful, and war would always appear. Unlike Mo Fan's previous world where humans constantly engaged in wars with each other, here it was about the coexistence of humans and demons!</p><p>Mo Fan did not know if Bohem would change under the next dawn or if mages could completely drive out the demons from there. He only held onto his own belief when Xin Xia fell asleep in his arms, exhausted... Just as Zhang Xiao Hou had cried to him: I must become stronger.</p><p>He was lucky because those he cared about most did not leave him in this disaster, but Mo Fan did not feel that he would always be so lucky...</p><p>If he had arrived at the freezer and held Xin Xia's cold corpse, he would have spent his entire life raging and screaming why he hadn't made himself stronger?</p><p>"Xin Xia, we're almost there," Mo Fan stared at the safety barrier. His inner turmoil had yet to subside.</p><p>"Hmm." Xin Xia breathed deeply. The feeling of living was truly wonderful.</p><p>"I heard there's a pair of winged demon wings. If your legs can't be cured, I'll turn you into a fairy," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"It's very expensive."</p><p>"Don't worry about the price, my dear brother is quite good at making money. Plus, I can even switch them to different styles: bird-type, butterfly-type, elf-type, flesh-winged type... Oh, oh, this one is too disgusting; it doesn't match our beautiful drawing style."</p><p>...</p><p>Finally returning to the safety barrier, the night passed quietly.</p><p>At dawn, the mist was just being parted by the rising sun, and beams of clean sunlight fell onto the mountains, rivers, and cities.</p><p>Mo Fan half-leaned against a wall, slowly opening his eyes.</p><p>He sensed someone cheering but couldn't figure out why. When he saw a large group of snow-white eagles appearing in the direction of the sunlight, Mo Fan was also moved.</p><p>Reinforcements!!</p><p>The reinforcements have finally arrived!!</p><p>A large group of eagles means that each eagle carries a mid-level magician!</p><p>The southern region's Bo City encountered such a disaster so suddenly, and given Bo City's relatively remote location, it naturally took some time for the military to send reinforcements.</p><p>However, judging from the way these eagles were flying over, there must have been considerable anger at the higher levels; otherwise, how could they mobilize such an ultra-premium eagle magician force?</p><p>Bo City itself had very few mid-level magicians. The nine eagle subordinates under Leader Zhan Kong were all fighting with Winged Gray Wolf, and their fate was uncertain. It would be difficult to have enough mid-level magicians to deal with the rampaging demons, especially those nightmare-like war-general level creatures.</p><p>The eagle magician corps quickly flew over Bo City and landed on the previous lookout tower.</p><p>Seeing one eagle after another landing in a majestic manner, and sensing the aura emitted by those military mages, it was clear that Bo City had finally been defended.</p><p>The objective of the Eagle Mage Guild was very simple: to hunt down the War General-level demons wandering in the city. Once the War General-level demons were eliminated, the remaining servant-level demons would be unable to withstand the collective magical bombardment of the Bocity mages. The previous night, most of the mages had to hide behind safety barriers to defend against the demons. Now, all the mages had gathered into squads and began hunting down demons throughout Bocity, starting from the safety barriers as their point of origin. One by one, the demon entry points were destroyed, reducing the number of demons in Bocity, and the entire city entered a sweeping phase. This sweep lasted for an entire week, including several thorough cleanings of the sewers. Perhaps there were a few demons that escaped, but they certainly dared not appear on the streets again. After numerous hunts, Bocity finally returned to a state of calm. However, Bocity was now unrecognizable, with destroyed buildings and collapsed bridges everywhere, leaving debris in its wake. Occasionally, some children would discover remains, which would scare them half to death... This Bocity was no longer the same Bocity from before; that rainstorm had left too many people traumatized, unable to sleep and fearing the rain even more. The entire city remained immersed in a grayish-white hue, with too many people losing their loved ones and too many sacrifices made. Even if the city still stood, it was as good as dead.</p><p>(Just a heads up, there will be three chapters today. On Saturday and Sunday, there will only be two chapters each day~~~~I'll take a break for a while. This weekend, I'm going out to walk around and relax my mind; otherwise, my neck won't be able to handle it.)</p>
