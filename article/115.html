						<p>Generally speaking, any star dust that breaks through to become a nebula can be called an intermediate-level mage.</p><p>That is to say, whether Mo Fan transforms his lightning-based star dust into a nebula or his fire-based star dust into a nebula, he will enter the realm of intermediate mages. However, this time, two star dusts transformed into clouds simultaneously, something that even he did not anticipate!!</p><p>"Zhi zhi zhi~~~~~~~ zhi zhi zhi zhi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A shrill scream echoed in Mo Fan's ears, accompanied by the piercing sound of an iron gate being torn open by the claws of the black beasts.</p><p>Mo Fan stood before the door, his eyes, which had not completely extinguished, tightly fixed on these greedy and ugly creatures.</p><p>Black beasts were the emblem of the Black Church; they were not actually summoned creatures but rather a mix of human zombies and the malevolent aura of some demon. They were closer to undead beings. These creatures embodied resentment, anger, and greed; once the people of the Black Church controlled their lifelines, they could wield them at will.</p><p>In addition to enjoying killing, these beasts had another huge obsession—to transform into this ghastly form and hope that everyone would become their dark slaves.</p><p>This hatred for evil was contagious, making them relentless.</p><p>A small iron gate could never block their desire. When greed did not manifest as hunger but merely the enjoyment of twisted torment and massacre, such greed was even more terrifying!!</p><p>Emerald green eyes, saliva dripping from the chin, restless claws, thirsty roars...</p><p>Perhaps half an hour ago, if more than two of these creatures appeared to Mo Fan, who was just an intermediate-level mage, it would have been a nightmare for him. Their speed could evade beginner spells, and they would cunningly cooperate in battle...</p><p>However, now, in Mo Fan's eyes, these monsters were mere pitiful and contemptible little fools. The transformed eyes no longer showed fear but instead revealed arrogance and disdain towards lower beings!</p><p>Mo Fan stood there, allowing them to tear open the iron gate.</p><p>"Rip~~~~~~~"</p><p>The iron gate finally broke open, and the black beasts in front rushed inside the door as if biting into their target's flesh could elevate their wicked souls.</p><p>Several heads, already mad with eagerness, crowded around, their bodies still stuck in the broken door opening. The black beast demons behind them pushed relentlessly, emitting frantic screams...</p><p>Seeing this scene, Mo Fan remained calm. He slowly took out the Star Chart Book.</p><p>Holding the star chart scroll in his palm, it suddenly floated before him as mana poured into it wildly, transforming into a constellation of star spots within his line of sight...</p><p>As the scroll vanished, the strange star map on it projected into Mo Fan's pupils.</p><p>One star, two stars, three stars...</p><p>The stars in Mo Fan's fire-type nebula seemed to be summoned; they eagerly connected with each other.</p><p>First, they formed star tracks, which were familiar to Mo Fan as the bridge for forming basic magic spells...</p><p>However, the spell Mo Fan was releasing was far from a basic magic!</p><p>As the star tracks continued to connect, a second set of star tracks appeared within the magic nebula again...</p><p>Stars connected into star tracks, and these tracks interwove in an intricate manner, forming a magnificent and awe-inspiring star map within the nebula!!</p><p>This is a star map!</p><p>It serves as a cornerstone for higher-level magic, opening the gate to intermediate magic spells!</p><p>Forty-nine stars transformed completely into a beautiful star pattern under the summoning of the Star Chart Book. These patterns not only shimmered in Mo Fan's pupils but also left clear prints beneath his feet!</p><p>Walking on the star map...</p><p>A massive amount of energy flooded into Mo Fan's body, causing him to burn like a flame.</p><p>"Blazing Fist!!"</p><p>Mo Fan spat out the name of the intermediate fire magic with intense hatred, his blood boiling under the scorching heat!! His gaze was filled with arrogance as he stared at these black beasts who dared to kill him. In the flames, one could see Mo Fan's lips curl upwards in a mix of madness and rage.</p><p>"Off to hell with you!" Mo Fan said each word deliberately.</p><p>Instantly, all the searing flames burning on his body gathered around his right wrist and tightly clenched fist.</p><p>The flames swirling around his fist were not just a mere blaze; it was a destructive force that would incinerate everything in its path!</p><p>Carrying Mo Fan's fury towards those who sought to destroy his hometown of Bocheng and kill his family, the explosive punch was unleashed with a roar!!</p><p>The blazing flames surrounding Mo Fan's fist erupted forth, first forming a huge ring of fire around his punch. It then burst into fiery tongues that danced wildly, shaping like a colossal fist larger than an entire wall!!</p><p>What about iron doors?</p><p>Mo Fan's fiery punch was aimed at the entire wall!</p><p>What about annihilating the incoming black beasts?</p><p>Mo Fan's explosive punch was intent on destroying all the black beasts in the corridor!!!</p><p>The majestic surge of flame energy roared, and the entire wall crumbled into black powder under this colossal fire fist.</p><p>Amidst the crimson blaze, the first black beast that came into contact with the massive flaming fist met the same fate as the wall, turning to ashes when hit by the blast!!!</p><p>"Screech screech~~~~~~~~~~~screech screech~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>In the corridor, the black beasts that were about to pounce on their prey let out panicked screams.</p><p>The mere heat wave hitting them made them scatter in fear. When the destructive flaming fist smashed towards them, those who failed to escape were incinerated by the blazing flames at the center of the punch!!!</p><p>The temperature around the fierce punch was not particularly high, yet this did not mean that the quick-reacting black beast demons could escape. They had just eagerly anticipated being the first to taste Mo Fan's fresh blood, causing them all to gather at the entrance. After Mo Fan unleashed his fierce punch, they were completely wiped out in one go. Moreover, the range of the fiery fists reached as far as a wall, so what was the point of running? "Boom!!! Boom!!! Boom!!!" The main control room's wall turned into black powder! The wall on the other side of the corridor was shattered to pieces! Finally, the reinforced glass outer wall facing the square cracked in large sections. The raging flames from the fiery fist instantly filled the adjacent restaurant, and then rushed out through the windows with a rumble. The black beast demons that were not incinerated by the high temperature were all blasted into the restaurant from the hallway, only to be fiercely hurled out of the window wall. Their screams could no longer be heard. Six black beast demons enveloped in flames crashed down from the third floor of the square, and immediately a rainstorm of glass and burning table fragments fell chaotically. The entire floor was filled with heat waves, causing the whole shopping mall to shake... Although the destruction process of the fierce punch was not long, it instantly reduced one wall, one corridor, and a Western restaurant to nothingness!! Ten black beast demons were directly annihilated, leaving only six alive. It is unlikely that they could get up, and they all fell on the square, surrounded by the burning debris.</p>
