						<p>Mo Fan took a glance at He Yu, who was sobbing until her sobs were barely audible. He could not help but sigh.</p><p>Xiao Ke was also a water mage; she too only mastered the second-level Water Control spell. However, in front of real demons, He Yu was no different from an ordinary girl. She couldn’t complete any skill at all. If everyone in the team was like this, more deaths would occur when they encountered demons again.</p><p>Mo Fan had no idea how many people would die; he could only push forward with gritted teeth.</p><p>"Since Teacher Xue asked me to lead the team, I hope everyone can remember what I’m about to say. We may not reach the safety barrier safely, but at least we can avoid some unnecessary deaths," Mo Fan said as he looked at the somewhat dazed pioneer squad.</p><p>This pioneer squad had underestimated demons too much. Training was training; the Shadow Wolf Beast did not have any murderous intentions towards students before it went berserk. Real demons, however, would do everything in their power to kill people. Even if they knew they were doomed, they would still use their last strength to drag someone else down. Demons naturally existed in an environment of mutual slaughter; they were too adept at giving enemies a fatal strike.</p><p>"There are mainly two types of demons we’ll face: the Giant Eyed Rats and the One-Eyed Demon Wolves. The Giant Eyed Rat is relatively easy to deal with, but the terrifying thing is the One-Eyed Demon Wolf. They are far more vicious and cunning than the Giant Eyed Rat. If we encounter three or more One-Eyed Demon Wolves, don’t hesitate; run for your lives. With good luck, only three of you will die. If you don’t run, all of you will die," Mo Fan stated firmly.</p><p>In fact, two One-Eyed Demon Wolves appearing at the same time would already be a fatal blow to this pioneer squad. Mo Fan now hoped that these students could understand that demons were a thousand times more terrifying than what teachers had said in class!</p><p>This was no longer practice or training; it was a fight for survival! Win, and live; lose, and all die!</p><p>Xu Zhao Ting, Wang Sanpang, Zhou Min, Mu Bai, Zhao Kunsan, Zhang Xiaohou, He Yu, Zhang Shuhua, Xue Mushi, and others were looking at Mo Fan. Mo Fan’s multiple warnings this time had indeed helped everyone avoid heavy casualties from the very beginning. While they listened intently, they secretly marveled: Why was Mo Fan so much sharper than his classmates, even though they were all senior three students?</p><p>Mo Fan told them about some of the most common mistakes, such as Wang Sanpang’s incredibly stupid behavior: never approach any demon that you think you’ve killed. It would use its last strength to take you down with it!</p><p>"Xiao Hou, be responsible for scouting and act cautiously in everything you do," Mo Fan instructed Zhang Xiaohou.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou nodded heavily; now he listened to everything Mo Fan said!</p><p>"Mu Bai, control your Ice Vines properly. Remember that Ice Vines are now used to protect everyone. Don’t expect to freeze demons with super-fast movement speeds," Mo Fan told Mu Bai.</p><p>Mu Bai frowned and thought about saying something but swallowed it back.</p><p>He had a great prejudice against Mo Fan, but compared to everyone’s lives, including his own, such prejudice was trivial. He nodded to indicate that he understood how to use Ice Vines properly.</p><p>Mo Fan quickly briefed everyone and couldn’t help taking a deep breath.</p><p>Actually, even he himself didn't know if he could survive this 3-kilometer death route. He only hoped that everyone's luck would be better and that they wouldn't encounter three one-eyed demon wolves at the same time.</p><p>...</p><p>The team continued to move forward. There were no demons encountered on the main street that stretched for a kilometer, but they did find some elderly people who hadn't managed to retreat to the safety barrier in some residential buildings.</p><p>The vanguard team couldn't escort any civilians. Xue Museng could only tell these elders to quickly follow the main force once it arrived there; otherwise, it would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>Almost all roads were blocked. Occasionally, they saw some people still attempting to drive their cars to the safety barrier, but in the end, they were stranded on the road and had to abandon their vehicles and walk.</p><p>Seeing people on the road, Xue Museng and Zhou Min would always tell them to find a place to hide first and follow the main force once it arrived.</p><p>After crossing this main street, they immediately reached Mingyuan Residential Area.</p><p>Mingyuan Residential Area was one of the more upscale elevator apartment buildings in Bocity. The entire area was decorated like a small park within the city, covering a large space. It would take nearly a kilometer to completely cross the four districts A, B, C, and D.</p><p>No one could say how many people were left behind in these row upon row of apartment buildings. They believed that being inside such tall buildings was safe... and it was safe...</p><p>The fence surrounding Mingyuan Residential Area was virtually useless; Mo Fan had already seen a few places where it had been destroyed, indicating that demons had definitely passed through this park-like residential area.</p><p>Entering through the side gate of the complex, the first thing they saw was a pond with a security guard's corpse floating on its surface, and the water in the pond turned red.</p><p>The heavy rain had ceased for a moment, making it even more impossible to wash away the bloodstains in the city. Seeing these bloodstains scattered everywhere, the vanguard team members couldn't help but feel their hair stand on end as they passed through.</p><p>"Did you hear that? Something is calling from that floor," Zhou Min whispered to Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan looked into one of the buildings and faintly saw a shadow that didn't belong to a human passing by the window.</p><p>"We should hurry forward." Mo Fan ignored it.</p><p>Zhou Min nodded, not daring to speak again.</p><p>Just a few steps forward, Zhang Xiaohou hurriedly returned from scouting ahead.</p><p>"There are more than five giant-eyed squirrels there; we need to detour," Zhang Xiaohou said.</p><p>"Hmm, let's take another route," Mo Fan nodded and patted Zhang Xiaohou on the shoulder, indicating that he had done well.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou could only manage a weak smile. In such an environment, if he did not force himself to grow, he would become a burden to the team. Although Zhang Xiaohou was also quite panicked, seeing Mo Fan remain so calm gave him some courage.</p><p>"There's a giant-eyed squirrel drinking at the swimming pool."</p><p>"Detour."</p><p>"Why? We could clearly kill it and go straight through."</p><p>Zhang Shuhua expressed his confusion.</p><p>"Don't engage in meaningless battles; magic power is more precious than water in the desert right now."</p>
