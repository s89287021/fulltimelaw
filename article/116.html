						<p>Mo Fan stood in the control room, which was now half-destroyed. His gaze penetrated through the burnt wreckage in front of him, taking in the entire square at a glance.</p><p>...</p><p>This was an intermediate-level fire magic!</p><p>It was really intermediate-level fire magic!!</p><p>The destructive power was completely on another level compared to beginner spells!!!</p><p>This was what magic truly looked like! The previous beginner magic arrays were pathetically weak!!</p><p>Damn You Yang, that **** black church dog, still wanted to kill Grandpa Mo Fan???</p><p>Shit, I can't get lost in awe anymore; Heart Summer is still in danger.</p><p>Mo Fan immediately realized the most important thing and no longer paid attention to those half-dead black beast demons. He sprinted towards Walmart.</p><p>After reaching the intermediate-level mage, Mo Fan felt a noticeable change in his physical condition. He ran to the railing and directly jumped down from the third floor.</p><p>Upon landing, his legs were surprisingly steady.</p><p>Mo Fan did not dare to waste a single second, racing towards Walmart like he was flying.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Mo Fan would definitely be cautious and carefully consider how to deal with the two giant-eyed squirrels still lingering around Walmart.</p><p>But now...</p><p>A Fireball directly blasted open Walmart's curled iron gate, who cares how many giant-eyed squirrels there are at Walmart?</p><p>Mo Fan rushed in, his gaze piercing through row after row of shelves, quickly locking onto the freezer he had seen on the surveillance camera.</p><p>Mo Fan was in a state of extreme anxiety, sprinting towards the relatively spacious aisle. At this moment, the two giant-eyed squirrels heard the commotion and poked their heads out.</p><p>Upon seeing a living human, the two giant-eyed squirrels let out excited squeals, and they flew at Mo Fan along the long shopping aisle.</p><p>The giant-eyed squirrels were very fast, with their large front teeth exposed in the air.</p><p>"Die, you piece of shit!!"</p><p>"Blazing Fist!"</p><p>Below him, a pattern glowing with fire energy blossomed!</p><p>Flame rapidly gathered on Mo Fan's wrist and tightly clenched right fist.</p><p>"PANG!! PANG!! PANG!! PANG!! PANG!! PANG!!"</p><p>The Blazing Fist struck out, reducing all the shelves to ashes under its power. The two giant-eyed squirrels, midway through their pounce, could feel how regretful they were in their hearts.</p><p>Why did they have such bad eyesight? They didn't recognize this as an intermediate-level mage among humans; how could their frail bodies withstand that massive blazing fist?</p><p>The flames engulfed them, turning them to ashes. It seemed like it happened in the blink of an eye...</p><p>Mo Fan slightly controlled his release, successfully killing the two giant-eyed squirrels before retracting the power of his fiery fists. Otherwise, the energy that would have exploded could turn this Walmart supermarket into a sea of fire, which would be a great sin if it harmed Xin Xia.</p><p>"Xin Xia, Xin Xia!!"</p><p>Mo Fan did not even glance at those powder residues as he rushed anxiously towards the refrigerator at the very end.</p><p>The wheelchair was right in front of him, and that huge refrigerator finally came into view. Mo Fan dashed to the refrigerator, forcefully slamming open its tightly closed door.</p><p>Inside the refrigerator, Ye Xin Xia lay like a Sleeping Beauty. Her skin had always been fair, but it now appeared ghastly pale.</p><p>Her serene face no longer had any hint of blood color.</p><p>Her eyes were tightly shut, with long eyelashes covered in frost, as if frozen tears.</p><p>Mo Fan hurriedly picked her up, only to feel an ice-coldness akin to death...</p><p>"Xin Xia!!"</p><p>Mo Fan was struck dumb like a thunderbolt.</p><p>"Wake up! Wake up quickly, I am Mo Fan, I am Mo Fan, I have come to save you!"</p><p>Flames burned on Mo Fan's body as he held Ye Xin Xia's delicate frame tightly in his arms, hoping that the flames could revive the frozen Ye Xin Xia.</p><p>Heat constantly transferred, swiftly melting away those ice fiends trying to take a girl's life.</p><p>Her body was gradually warming up.</p><p>Her breath, which had almost ceased, began to resume...</p><p>Opening her heavy eyes, feeling a scorching body tightly pressed against her, Ye Xin Xia experienced a warmth she had never felt before, along with an incredibly familiar scent.</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan?" Ye Xin Xia's voice was so weak that it was barely audible, tinged with a trace of disbelief she didn't dare to acknowledge.</p><p>It was said that people would have illusions before death. Ye Xin Xia was somewhat afraid that this was the happiest scene the little match girl had seen in her last flicker of light. But the feeling of being tightly embraced felt very real.</p><p>Mo Fan heard her voice and only then realized that Ye Xin Xia's eyes were open, leaving him speechless for a moment.</p><p>In the face of disaster, everyone's life seemed so fragile. Mo Fan had seen too many girls die in this disaster, and he was really afraid that something similar would happen to Ye Xin Xia. After all, others still had the ability to escape, but what about her?</p><p>Mo Fan resolutely came here because he knew that the immobilized Ye Xin Xia would definitely be left behind somewhere, helplessly awaiting death...</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan, I thought I would never... ever see you again," Ye Xin Xia's heart melted. Her gentle arms unconsciously tightened around Mo Fan's neck as if she no longer wanted to let go, more like wanting to merge into his warm body.</p><p>"How could I abandon you?" Mo Fan said.</p><p>Ye Xin Xia didn't speak again, only tightening her grip even more.</p><p>The whole world might abandon her, but Mo Fan never would... She had never doubted this point.</p><p>...</p><p>When the disaster erupted and she was left abandoned in this cold underground supermarket, Ye Xin Xia hadn't shed a single tear. But when Mo Fan really appeared before her, it felt as if tears could not be held back and streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.</p>
