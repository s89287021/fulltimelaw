						<p>Mo Fan, you... you damn brat! What did you say? Apologize to Mr. Mu Zhuoyun right away!" Mu He said furiously.</p><p>This Mo Fan, is he truly beyond redemption or what? Daring to act this way in front of Mr. Mu Zhuoyun, the whole family has had enough!</p><p>"Apology, of course I can, but he also needs to apologize for what happened three years ago. Don't use your high cultivation and power to bully me; with Mr. Mu Zhuoyun's cultivation, he only dares to bully someone like me who hasn't even turned 18 yet. To put it simply, if you were my age, I could beat you so badly that you'd be crawling on the ground!" Mo Fan's fearlessness and audacity were fully displayed at this moment.</p><p>"Bullshit!" Mu Zhuoyun was truly enraged by this brat and blurted out a curse word.</p><p>At his age, even though he didn't have the exceptional talent of Mu Ningxue, he still considered himself a genius. He wouldn't give any thought to these students from Tianlan Magic High School!</p><p>"Mo Fan, you really are bold! Don't say it was when Mr. Mu Zhuoyun was young; even now, any core disciple from our Mu Clan could knock you down with one move!"</p><p>"Yes, yes, and not even a clan disciple is needed! I, Mu Bai, can have a magical duel with you right now. If you lose, kneel down and apologize to Mr. Mu right away!" Mu Bai jumped out at the perfect moment to serve Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>He, Mu Bai, was Mo Fan's peer, so they should fight fairly; see what he had to say!</p><p>With this name in mind, Mu Bai would beat Mo Fan mercilessly and vent his anger on behalf of Mr. Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>"Not necessary."</p><p>Just as Mu Bai was about to step forward, a proud yet slightly cold voice rang out.</p><p>Everyone's gaze immediately turned to the speaker.</p><p>The speaker was none other than Mu Ningxue. Who could have thought that she would come forward at this moment?</p><p>Mu Ningxue walked between her father and Mo Fan. Her eyes, as pure as the snow on Tianshan Mountain, carried a hint of anger.</p><p>She was clearly angry at Mo Fan.</p><p>"Since you say my father only bullies juniors and uses his power to suppress you, a mage who cultivated on your own... then fine, I'm the same age as you; let's compete!" Mu Ningxue's calm voice carried an icy strength akin to mountain snow!</p><p>Mo Fan, you… you damned brat! What did you say? Apologize to Mr. Mu Zhuoyun right away!" Mu He said in a fit of rage.</p><p>This Mo Fan, is he truly beyond redemption or what?

Mu Ningxue’s calm voice carried an icy strength akin to mountain snow!</p><p>"Ning Xue??" Mu Zhuoyun saw his daughter walk out, and the anger on his face turned to astonishment.</p><p>Mo Fan looked at Ning Xue, who was facing him directly, with a lazy smile that seemed to defy death.</p><p>It's quite interesting, Ning Xue has come out.</p><p>To be honest, fighting Mou Bai this scoundrel is not very meaningful. I've already squeezed him dry today. On the other hand, Ning Xue is renowned as the top female genius in Bole City and a pride of the Imperial Capital. It seems that fighting her would be much more interesting.</p><p>"Ning Xue, dealing with this guy is my job; you don't need to get involved..." Mou Bai hurriedly said with a forced smile.</p><p>"My father has been insulted, and although my father can be magnanimous and not bother with such lowlife scoundrels, as his daughter, I cannot let the person who insulted my father go unpunished. Let's settle this fairly with a magical duel!" Ning Xue said each word seriously, leaving no room for argument in her tone.</p><p>"Excellent! Excellent! This ice-cold backbone fills us elders with great satisfaction. You truly are the first genius of Bole City, displaying exceptional talent at such a young age and being so righteous." Director Deng Kai immediately began praising her.</p><p>After his praise, Director Deng Kai patted Mu Zhuoyun's shoulder and continued, "Brother Zhuoyun, it's not really necessary for you to punish this insolent boy. He isn't overly confident in his abilities enough to overpower you from back then; it's impossible for you to return to your 16-year-old self to fight him again. This matter will be handled by your daughter, Ning Xue, who will make that presumptuous brat speechless."</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun didn't speak but simply looked at Deng Kai.</p><p>Seeing that Mu Zhuoyun could control his temper, Deng Kai smiled slightly and walked in front of Mo Fan, saying, "Are you Mo Fan? As the leader of Bole City's Hunter Alliance, I don't know whether to describe your actions today as youthful ignorance or sheer stupidity. However, you should really apologize to Mr. Mu Zhuoyun for your rash behavior; his contributions to Bole City are far beyond what you can comprehend."</p><p>"Apology, no problem. I can carry thorns on my back and use the traditional method of kneeling to apologize until he's satisfied. But the precondition is that the Mus have the ability to deserve such an apology. Ask him yourself what he said to my family three years ago; I will only apologize after he apologizes for those events. As a prominent figure in Bole City, he should know better than to provoke ordinary people. Ordinary people might be killed by you with one slap, but before that happens, they will definitely curse you until you're braindead!" Mo Fan cursed without any reservations.</p><p>"This is a society governed by law; how could such things happen? At most, you'll be expelled."</p><p>"Alright, since the situation has reached this point, it's not as bad as I imagined. Let's follow what Ning Xue said: she will duel with you magically. If you lose, you will apologize to Mu Zhuoyun until he is satisfied. If Ning Xue loses..."</p><p>Deng Kai looked at Mu Zhuoyun as he spoke.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun snorted coldly, "How could Ning Xue possibly lose?"</p><p>"Stop wasting words and just tell me if you dare!"</p><p>Mo Fan's words carried a hint of sharpness!</p><p>Dignity is not more noble because they belong to prominent families, nor should it be beneath them simply because his family is destitute. Mo Fan was just an ordinary person, an eye-for-an-eye ordinary person!</p><p>Let him join Mu Family?</p><p>He wouldn't forget the words Mu Zhuoyun said to him three years ago, which were as harsh as stepping on a dog. He also wouldn't forget how Mu He had caused his family's downfall. If he went back just because Mu Zhuoyun offered him some scraps, then he would be no better than a dog, and what difference would there be between him and Zhao Kunsan or Mu Bai?</p><p>As for being cursed?</p><p>That was only natural!</p><p>Three years ago, when he was still thirteen, he had dared to point at Mu Zhuoyun and call him an old rogue. Now that he was sixteen or seventeen, how could he possibly be afraid of him?</p><p>The saying "once bitten by a snake, ten years wary of ropes" did not apply to Mo Fan. If a snake dared to bite him, he would definitely play with the snake as if it were a rope!</p><p>When you are perceived as an ant in someone's eyes, no matter how fast you run, you can't escape their huge feet. It's better to curse freely.</p><p>"Brother Zhuoyun, what do you think?" Deng Kai showed himself to be a mediator.</p><p>This argument and shouting match was taking place in front of the entire school. If they could turn this somewhat embarrassing situation into a fair magical duel, that would be ideal. Otherwise, expelling that student named Mo Fan from school would have no real meaning and would lose the school a talent. He had been a promising seedling at Tianlan Magic High School, having secured first place.</p><p>"I can't deal with you anymore, little brat!" Mu Zhuoyun glanced at Mu Ningxue and said, "Ningxue, this matter doesn't concern you."</p>
