But he never imagined that Mo Fan was naturally dual-elemental and had even cultivated the Lightning Seal to level 3!</p><p>The entire grand coming-of-age ceremony had become a spectacular showcase of this young man's remarkable debut, leaving everyone feeling like they had done all the work for nothing. That feeling was akin to wearing a green hat—exasperating and frustrating.</p><p>"That... it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Mr. Mu Zhuoyun has always been rather kind to us. Mo Fan, let's just let this slide," said Mo Jiaxing, who at heart remained a good person. In his view, having Mu Zhuoyun kneel and apologize to him would be no different from killing him outright; after all, he was still an influential figure.</p><p>"Yes, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Let's just enjoy the show tonight," Mu He jumped in quickly, his attitude completely different from before, almost like a friendly businessman with ulterior motives.</p><p>Forgotten??</p><p>Damn, if that old bastard Mu Zhuoyun had shown any sign of forgiving them earlier, Mo Fan wouldn't have needed to use lightning to kill them!</p><p>"Humph, one bow and an apology means nothing. My word is my bond, I'll admit defeat!" Mu Zhuoyun spat out these words fiercely.</p><p>No sooner had he said it than Mu Zhuoyun stood right in front of Mo Jiaxing.</p><p>His words were resounding, but his actions seemed somewhat stiff.</p><p>Was he really going to kneel and apologize to them father and son?</p><p>By doing so, he wouldn't have to lift his head anymore in Bocity.</p><p>Damnit, damnit. How could this heaven-defying talent of being dual-element end up on that brat Mo Fan? No wonder he had dared to challenge him with such confidence at the time; it turned out he had this trump card in hand.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun, fox-like and calculating as he was, hadn't counted on his opponent having innate dual-element abilities.</p><p>After some struggle, Mu Zhuoyun gritted his teeth and slowly bent his knees.</p><p>"Brother Mu Zhuoyun, no need for that, no need. Sigh, we don't have any deep-seated enmity. Why must things come to this? And it's not like we're living in ancient times; such displays are outdated. Even ancients would laugh off such grudges. What are we even fighting about?"</p><p>Mo Jiaxing hurriedly helped Mu Zhuoyun up.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun looked at Mo Jiaxing in surprise.</p><p>In his view, most people in this situation should be benefiting greatly, but not everyone could withstand the humiliation of being knelt to by him, Mu Zhuoyun. Furthermore, Mo Jiaxing had just done the same thing to him earlier.</p><p>"Mo Fan, this is good enough," said Mo Jiaying, turning to Mo Fan.</p><p>"Well said, ancient people have their own way of laughing off grudges. Today should actually be a cause for celebration because our city has given birth to another prodigy who is truly breathtaking in being naturally gifted in dual elemental abilities. Not long ago, Mu Ningxue’s natural spirit seed had already made us feel that our city will surely gain more fame in the future. Who would have thought that Mo Fan’s natural dual-elemental talent was even more astonishing? Truly, Heaven favors our Bocheng!"</p><p>Bocheng didn’t stand out particularly among cities in the south; it mostly lacked exceptionally talented magicians. It had been silent for so many years in the southern region.</p><p>However, Mu Ningxue’s natural spirit seed and Mo Fan’s natural dual-elemental abilities were definitely going to cause a huge stir, making Bocheng the most eye-catching city in the entire south!!</p><p>Just thinking about it was exhilarating.</p><p>"Mo Fan, let me put it this way: if you join our military department, I can ensure that you become the leader of the city’s military department in the future. Abundant cultivation resources aside, you are sure to rise high," said Zhankaong with unusual seriousness.</p><p>"Zhankaong, enough already. Choosing which faction to support is everyone’s freedom; what do you mean by forcing it?" Yang Zuohé said unhappily.</p><p>"F*ck, am I forcing it? He and I have always been sworn brothers; he is my adopted younger brother," Zhankaong said with wide eyes.</p><p>The two instructors, Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun, were sweating profusely on the side.</p><p>Boss Zhankaong, when did Mo Fan become your sworn brother?</p><p>"Head Instructor, what are you doing?" Mo Fan was also speechless.</p><p>"Oh? You’re not satisfied? How about you be the elder brother then; I can be your adopted elder brother too. Anyway, if you join our military department, I guarantee you a life of luxury and glory," Zhankaong immediately said.</p><p>Luo Yunbo and Pan Lijun were now drenched in sweat.</p><p>D*mn, as the leader of Bocheng’s military department, recognizing this eighteen-year-old boy as your adopted elder brother would surely cause your entire army to collapse. Can you have a bit more dignity, Boss Zhankaong?</p><p>At this moment, the two instructors really wanted to drag Shankan Laogong away; it was too embarrassing!</p>
