						<p>The next second, this group of magic students all transformed into frightened wild birds, colliding and crowding each other in panic, rushing out towards the cave entrance.</p><p>"Run, what are you standing there for!!" Zhang Xiaohou saw He Yu beside him had frozen in fear. Without hesitation, he grabbed her arm.</p><p>"W…w…wind track…damn!!"</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou tried to complete the magic spell, but with his heart pounding wildly, his stars could not connect at all.</p><p>During practice, he had been able to complete the star tracks with 100% accuracy. Zhang Xiaohou himself felt that he had mastered the magic perfectly. However, when a terrifying demon was just 20 meters away, he realized that everything he had learned was nonsense!</p><p>The stars, which were usually obedient, behaved like frightened deer, colliding randomly in these magic students' star dust. No one would think of casting spells at this moment; everyone relied on instinct to flee towards the cave entrance.</p><p>"Fan Ge, Fan Ge, quickly…run!" Zhang Xiaohou dragged He Yu, who was stunned with fear, out of the cave.</p><p>Mo Fan had no difference from these fleeing students at that moment. Especially amidst the screaming, crying, and even wetting their pants, he could not fully concentrate to release his magic spell either...</p><p>It couldn't be helped; I have to run too.</p><p>Mo Fan's stars could connect up to the 6th one, but when that demon roared, his concentration was instantly shattered. There was no way he could cast a magic spell anymore.</p><p>In desperation, he grabbed Zhou Min beside him.</p><p>"Let go of me! I will hold this one-eyed demon wolf back. You all hurry and calm down," Zhou Min was a stubborn girl who did not care for her life.</p><p>"Do you have a problem with your head?!" Mo Fan simply lifted Zhou Min up.</p><p>Zhou Min looked tough, but she was actually just a delicate young girl. After practicing lightning magic, Mo Fan's overall physical strength had increased somewhat; it wasn't too difficult to carry Zhou Min and run.</p><p>It wasn't that Mo Fan didn't want to give Zhou Min the chance to cast spells; it was that even in this situation, he could only connect 6 stars. A girl whose cultivation level was far below his couldn't possibly complete it!</p><p>At a time like this, don't act tough like the class president; just run as far as you can.</p><p>Mo Fan carried Zhou Min as he sprinted, the screams and shouts ringing painfully in his ears.</p><p>"Damnit, no wonder those veterans at the station mocked us. It turns out that we, who practiced with puppets in school, were nothing but a bunch of failures when faced with real demons; none of us completed any magic, our first instinct was to flee... but fleeing means being killed one by one. We climbed up the mountain pass using a rope, and we could only escape as far as that mountain pass. There was only one rope, and few people could climb down it."</p><p>Mo Fan's mind was still somewhat disoriented; he tried his best to calm himself and think clearly, but the horror of the demons far exceeded their imagination.</p><p>This feeling was like watching a horror movie; if you just watched the visuals, horror movies weren't so unbearable.</p><p>However, when you turned on the sound effects, the terror level of the film increased by many levels.</p><p>At this moment, it wasn't just about watching a horror movie; it was as though real ghosts had crawled out from the screen, right in front of your eyes, and you could even clearly see the blood trickling from their eyes...</p><p>In such a situation, no one could remain calm!</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan ran relatively fast, carrying Zhou Min out of the mountain pass. By then, Zhou Min was already too scared to stand.</p><p>It was too terrifying; everything they were experiencing was really too terrifying, a thousand times more real and frightening than any nightmare they had ever had!</p><p>"God, where's the rope!!"</p><p>"No, no, I don't want to die here!!"</p><p>"What's going on??" Mu Bai and Xu Zhao Ting were still somewhat rational, but from their pitiful appearances, it was clear that neither of them had cast any magic.</p><p>At least ten people had been frightened unconscious in the cave. The twenty or so who managed to escape tried to slide down using the rope.</p><p>However, the rope was gone!!</p><p>Now, unless they jumped directly down...</p><p>"What can we do, are we all going to die here?!" Zhao Kunsan trembled in fear.</p><p>In fact, apart from the stench of the one-eyed devil wolf's breath, there was a thick smell of urine permeating the air. Many students whose pants and underwear were wet could be seen everywhere.</p><p>"The one-eyed devil wolf has chased us out. I’d rather die than be eaten alive," said a male student with water magic abilities.</p><p>"Damn it, so many have fainted in the cave, why didn’t that thing go for them instead of chasing after us?" Zhao Kunsan remarked.</p><p>Zhou Min and Xu Shaoting were scared, but they glared fiercely at Zhao Kunsan when they heard such monstrous words from him.</p><p>"There's no point in running; we need to unite and face it together."</p><p>"How do we face it? I can't even remember what faculty I’m in anymore."</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>Three hundred meters away from the mountain pass was a stone platform extending from the cliff wall.</p><p>At this location, Head Instructor Zhan Kong, Instructor Luo Yunbo, Pan LiJun, and the summoner Bai Yang were standing there, observing the group of students trapped at the mountain pass from afar.</p><p>The summoner named Bai Yang was laughing uncontrollably, holding his stomach. From his vantage point, he could see one student so terrified that they had wet their pants and collapsed on the ground.</p><p>Head Instructor Zhan Kong looked at the group of students who hadn’t managed to cast a single spell and shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>It was incredibly disappointing.</p><p>He had thought that this year's students from Tianlan Magic High School would have some skills, but none of them had been able to cast any spells so far.</p><p>They say that students are just armchair mages, and it turns out to be true. The school spends so many resources training them, yet they behave like this when faced with demons.</p><p>Zhang Jianguo, Xue Musheng, and Chen Weiliang all looked awkward at this moment.</p><p>They were well aware of each student's capabilities; the school usually focused on their cultivation scores so that the reports would look good. As for practical skills, they often just passed by.</p><p>Combat practice was something one had to experience firsthand; how could schools teach it?</p><p>"Hmm? Someone released a spell." Luo Yunbo, with sharp eyes, noticed a white light flashing at the mountain pass in the distance.</p><p>"It's an Ice-type... That person seems to be Mu Bai!" Xue Musheng immediately broke into a smile.</p><p>Chen Weiliang and Zhang Jianguo also looked over quickly. Indeed, the first person to release a spell was Mu Bai.</p><p>A white frosty aura surrounded the area where Mu Bai stood. The ice fairy spirits transformed into a surging army of soldiers, swiftly covering the limbs of the ghost wolf that had just emerged from the cave!</p><p>"Hmm, note it down." Chief Instructor Zhankaong said.</p><p>"This is a descendant of the Mu Family, influenced by the family's traditions, possessing an aura typical of clan heirs. His mental strength and adaptability are much stronger than other students." Xue Musheng hurriedly explained.</p><p>Clan heirs were indeed different; while other students were on the verge of mental breakdowns, Mu Bai had remained calm enough to release a spell.</p><p>Being able to release his Ice-type skill, Frost Vines, under such fear, Mu Bai could already secure an A grade, an excellent performance.</p><p>Now, it was up to see if other students could remain calm.</p>
