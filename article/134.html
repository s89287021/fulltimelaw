						<p>The curse was gradually being lifted, and Mo Fan’s idle chat with Zhao He wasn’t completely useless; at the very least, it had saved Teacher Tang Yue from a fate similar to that of the four Eastern Family members.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, are you alright?" Mo Fan walked over to where Tang Yue was softly leaning against a rock.</p><p>At this moment, Tang Yue’s robe was partially open, and with her hands covering her chest, it was unclear whether she wanted to protect her pure body or tear off her clothes directly.</p><p>"Don’t… don’t come closer…" Tang Yue forced herself to sit still while fighting back the thoughts invading her mind.</p><p>Now, within a radius of several kilometers, there was probably only this guy, Mo Fan, as a male. She had always thought such frustrating events would only happen in TV dramas, but now they were happening to her. If Mo Fan were a handsome and dashing prince with looks like a painting, she might have endured it! </p><p>No way, under these circumstances, any normal man would take advantage of the situation. She needed to find a way to make this guy leave; if she could get about ten minutes of quiet time, her willpower should be enough to overcome this, and a Mage’s mental strength was much greater than that of an ordinary person.</p><p>Right, Meiyan!</p><p>This kind of thing was supposed to go to the Judging Council, but now she had no choice but to give it to him.</p><p>"You… you go refine Meiyan," Tang Yue took a deep breath and said.</p><p>"Meiyan can be refined at any time; your safety is more important." Mo Fan replied seriously.</p><p>Tang Yue couldn’t bring herself to look at Mo Fan, cursing inwardly: Mo Fan, you damn bastard, hurry up and take this reward away from me! Don’t tell your old lady that you don’t know what’s happening right now, if you dare take one more step closer, I’ll stomp on you and feed you to the dogs!!</p><p>Honestly, Tang Yue was a bit worried about what this guy might do to her or what she might do to him. She gritted her teeth and said, "The Spirit-grade Fire Seed will dissipate soon."</p><p>"Oh, oh, really for me?" Mo Fan asked seriously.</p><p>"Yes!!!" Tang Yue’s silver teeth nearly broke from clenching so hard.</p><p>"Then take care of yourself; I’ll go refine Meiyan first. If you need anything…"</p><p>"Get lost!!!" Tang Yue was almost driven mad.</p><p>Mo Fan walked away reluctantly, muttering to himself. He looked like Xiao Ming from those stories, who humbly asked the female teacher a question but was brutally chased out, only to leave the female restroom while lamenting how unprofessional female teachers were these days.</p><p>However, thinking about obtaining such an expensive Fire Elemental Seed, Mo Fan immediately forgot everything else! </p><p>Meiyan's temptation to Mo Fan was equally lethal.</p><p>Now, he was as poor as a church mouse. How could he not want something so rare!</p><p>The Eastern Family's Pan Xiong Hunter Mage team, including this wanted murderer, had fought over Meiyan until they were battered and bruised. From the beginning, Mo Fan wanted Meiyan, and he really owed Teacher Tang Yue for being caught in her trap; otherwise, it was impossible that such a treasure would fall into his hands.</p><p>At present, Tang Yue was struggling internally against the evil within herself to preserve her innocence. Excitement made her little hand tremble as she obtained the treasure she desired.</p><p>"Quickly refine it and take Teacher Tang Yue away. If another mage shows up, we'll be in big trouble—nothing but loss of money and beauty!" Mo Fan thought to himself.</p><p>Mo Fan didn't dare waste any time; he quickly plunged his palm into the special Meiyan.</p><p>A burning sensation spread throughout his body from his palm, initially unbearable due to its heat. However, he soon realized that this spiritually infused Meiyan seemed to have no intention of harming humans at all.</p><p>Gradually, it felt as if scorching blood was flowing into his body. Mo Fan closed his eyes and focused on sensing this strange element.</p><p>Meiyan was indeed very docile; it resembled a newborn baby who instinctively relied on the first person to approach it as its parent. After initial wariness, it completely let down its guard and opened its tender hands to embrace Mo Fan, merging into his body and into his Fire Nebula.</p><p>During this process, Mo Fan felt as if he was undergoing a baptism of fire; even impure flames were constantly transforming under Meiyan's influence!</p><p>The first change occurred in Mo Fan's skin, which was slightly tanned but not quite the color of ancient bronze. After absorbing Meiyan, his complexion gradually took on its luster, becoming radiant and smooth.</p><p>The blood within his body seemed to have been transformed, becoming more lustrous and noble. </p><p>After the blood, came the bones. Mo Fan's bones were originally no different from those of a normal person, but under the baptism of Mei Yan, they resembled steel forged through repeated refining. Although Mo Fan might not be able to see this change himself, he could clearly feel the significant difference compared to before.</p><p>The greatest transformation was naturally in the fire nebula of his spiritual world!</p><p>The crimson nebula originally still displayed some impurities, merely being splendid in the vast expanse of the spirit universe. The arrival of Mei Yan elevated the lineage of this fire nebula to a new level...</p><p>The nebula itself already presented a swirling form. After the crimson baptism turned it into a rosy hue, the entire dark cosmos seemed to bloom with an exquisite and mysterious rose, absolutely beautiful and independent!</p><p>The refinement brought immediate results!</p><p>Even without using any skill, Mo Fan could sense that Mei Yan harbored far greater power than ordinary crimson flames!</p><p>It was inactive and not agitated; it bloomed in solitude. But Mo Fan knew that it was as dangerous and terrifying as a rose thorn!</p><p>...</p><p>Originally, if Mo Fan's Fire Surge · Explosion hit a demon completely, he would likely inflict a severe injury.</p><p>With this Mei Yan, whose power had more than doubled, a single Fire Surge · Explosion could basically directly reduce an ordinary demon to half its strength, even achieving instant kills!</p><p>Most demons were very fast in their movements; they couldn't stand still like targets for the Fire Surge to hit. Even other mages who possessed Mei Yan would likely only see improved effects.</p><p>But Mo Fan was a naturally dual-elemental man!</p><p>He would first use Thunder Seal to forcibly control the demon, then immediately follow up with "Mei Yan · Fire Surge · Explosion," an absolute instant kill!</p><p>Now, Mo Fan's release of Thunder Seal required no more than 1.5 seconds, and Fire Surge also didn't exceed 1.5 seconds!</p><p>Given just 3 seconds, demons like One-eyed Wolf and Giant-eyed Rat would undoubtedly be destroyed, so unreasonable it was!!</p><p>The mana consumption of basic magic is not very high, so now Mo Fan can easily carve out a path for himself as long as he is not surrounded by demons. Even if he gets unlucky and is surrounded, they will get to taste the raging power of Flame Fist Ace!!</p>
