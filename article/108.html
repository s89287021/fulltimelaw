						<p>"Isn't that Mo Fan...? What a mistake, we're already inside the safety barrier. Why is he running out?" Xue Musheng was resting at the campsite nearby and saw Mo Fan walking out of the safety barrier.</p><p>"I can't believe I'll ever want to go outside again in my life."</p><p>"Yeah, Mo Fan has too much courage."</p><p>To this group of students, a barrier away meant a nightmare that they would never forget. Having finally arrived here, there was no way they would step out.</p><p>They couldn't understand what gave Mo Fan the courage to step out of the safety barrier.</p><p>...</p><p>In fact, Mo Fan had also thought that once he entered the safety barrier, he wouldn't come out again. Compared to his life, anything else could be forgotten. As for a heart dedicated to saving the world?</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't feel he possessed it. In fact, his sentiment didn't even reach Captain Xu Dahuang's level.</p><p>Many people felt they played an insignificant role in society, things that were morally just weren't something they could do, often sighing at how some people would risk their lives to do certain things... In reality, some things had already surpassed themselves in importance, often without even realizing it. Only when such things happened did the decisions made become instinctive, regardless of the cost, they would still be resolute.</p><p>Mo Fan was like this now.</p><p>He hadn't thought about whether he should step out of the safety barrier again. His mind was occupied with terrifying speculations, every part of his body telling him that he must not let such a tragedy happen to Xinxia!</p><p>...</p><p>Xu Dahuang was quite familiar with the entire city of Bocheng. Following his lead would reduce many unnecessary troubles.</p><p>The Demon Hunting Team's water mage, Xiao Ke, ultimately did not choose to follow the team out. Everyone has their own choices. Colonel Cheng and Xu Dahan did not force him.</p><p>Another two familiar figures to Mo Fan who executed this mission together were Rou Yunbo and Pan Lijun, both of whom were responsible for leading the team. The leader of the team was precisely Colonel Cheng, a mid-rank mage.</p><p>Colonel Cheng was an official guardian of Bocity. This arduous task also had to be personally carried out by him.</p><p>The total number of people in the team was only eight. The number of people in this team could not be too large. On one hand, making too much noise would make it easy for demons to discover their intentions. On the other hand, the entire safety barrier zone already lacked sufficient manpower. Being able to dispatch a mid-rank mage as a leader was already quite impressive. After all, there were some numbers of demon warlords in action within Bocity, and these warlord-level demons could only be dealt with by mid-rank mages.</p><p>This elevated highway had long been filled with chaotic cars, making it completely impassable. Faintly visible were several figures of demons darting among the car convoys, searching for those citizens who believed they would be safe inside their vehicles.</p><p>At this moment, amidst the chaotic elevated highway, eight black off-road motorcycles silently sped along the relatively clear edge of the bridge. The metallic texture of the motorcycles was very smooth, looking from a distance like eight all-black African leopards running at full speed. The dim light after the rain highlighted their occasional flashes of cold radiance!</p><p>"Although motorcycles powered by dark stones are less likely to be detected by demons, it is still more advantageous in combat to have a summoned beast as a mount in such situations," Colonel Cheng said.</p><p>"It's a pity that summoners all have their own tasks," Pan Lijun stated.</p><p>Colonel Cheng nodded without further comment.</p><p>Mo Fan was also driving a black off-road motorcycle. He had mastered the skills of riding motorcycles in middle school.</p><p>When Mo Fan was at the magic academy, his teachers had specially emphasized that all magical technology devices were actually quite easy to attract demons' attention. After all, whether it was mobile phones, computers, cars, or motorcycles, they were all manufactured through different types of magic blueprints and required energy-filled magic stones for operation.</p><p>The energy in magic stones was very easy for demons to sense.</p><p>While the magic stones made into technological devices might not be particularly attractive to these demons, a rapidly moving magic stone... that would be different. Just as many animals have no reaction to stationary objects but instinctively chase after moving things, this is similar to why demons are easily attracted by moving cars and motorcycles.</p><p>Therefore, apart from devices specially processed by the military that could be used normally, using technological devices generally attracted surrounding demons. How far their influence reached depended on the range of those demons' perception capabilities.</p><p>Through the exchange among several military mages, Mo Fan learned an important piece of information: Most mages would use summoned beasts as their means of transportation. The aura of summoned beasts was inherently similar to that of demons, making it not easy for demons to notice them when riding on summoned beasts outside the city. Similarly, if a situation arose in the city and traffic came to a halt, summoned beasts were the only creatures capable of rapidly moving through blocked urban roads. Similar to the military's ace summoned beast—the Sky Eagle!</p><p>Unfortunately, most people's first awoke ability can only be elemental magic. Dimensional magic like Summoning is usually awakened by mid to high-level mages. Therefore, summon beasts cannot be so common.</p><p>...</p><p>After passing through the Mei Xin Overpass, everyone's progress was still quite fast.</p><p>However, as they were about to reach the Rune Zone, part of the bridge clearly collapsed, indicating that a War General Demon must have passed through here.</p><p>As such, everyone had no choice but to abandon their vehicles and walk. Technology-based transportation is extremely inconvenient in this regard; it relies too much on roads.</p><p>After abandoning their vehicles, the eight people continued walking. Coachman Luo Yunbo was a Wind Mage and was leading the way ahead.</p><p>Luo Yunbo's experience was even richer than Li Wenjie's. He could even use his Wind Track Magic to lure demons ahead so they could pass through directly.</p><p>Such a Wind Mage is too important for the team, saving a lot of time and enhancing everyone's combat effectiveness.</p><p>The journey was long with many unknowns ahead; reducing battles as much as possible was crucial.</p><p>(Don't know if it's my issue or the website backend has gone down, I couldn't access the author backend for a very long time and still haven't updated... There are three chapters today, this is the first one, another will be released at 9 PM, and then another at midnight.)</p>
