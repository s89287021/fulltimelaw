						<p>"There are some homeless people living here. The homeless are never included in the police's population statistics. This one-eyed werewolf is very cunning; it hides in abandoned construction sites and relies on the unnoticed homeless for food. If we hadn't discovered it, I have no idea how many more people would become its prey," Mo Fan said with a cold snort.</p><p>Zhou Min was so scared that she couldn't speak. She had only come here to investigate the source of the problem, but instead, she encountered a flesh-eating monster. Even though the population of Bocheng was close to a million and there were deaths every day, it didn't mean that living people should be eaten by demons lurking in such places. It was too terrifying; everything was too terrifying!</p><p>"Speaking of Zhou Min, don't you think this one-eyed werewolf is different from what our teachers described?" Mo Fan stared at the troublesome beast from a distance.</p><p>How could Zhou Min even think about such questions now? She was only thinking about how to escape this construction site undetected and then immediately inform the Hunter Alliance about this terrifying news.</p><p>"It seems larger than what our teachers described, almost two sizes bigger. It's not an ordinary one-eyed werewolf," Mo Fan continued.</p><p>Zhou Min was on the verge of going crazy.</p><p>Can't we first think of a way to get out of here? How can Mo Fan be so brave?!!</p><p>Mo Fan quickly realized that Zhou Min was just an arrogant little girl in school who had no intention of discussing anything when faced with such a terrifying scene.</p><p>"You leave first. Call the city demon-hunting team's hotline and have the police disperse the nearby residents and homeless people," Mo Fan said to Zhou Min.</p><p>"What about you?" Zhou Min asked.</p><p>"I'll stay here and watch it," Mo Fan replied.</p><p>Zhou Min looked at Mo Fan as if he were a monster.</p><p>They were both senior high school students, but why was this guy completely unmoved by the scene? Normal people would be scared enough to wet their pants, right?</p><p>Upon closer thought, Zhou Min suddenly realized that this super abnormal individual had killed shadow wolves. It seemed that demons didn't cause him much fear.</p><p>Freak, a freak.</p><p>"I… I've already called them," Zhou Min whispered.</p><p>Mo Fan was puzzled and casually asked, "How did you notify... f*ck!!"</p><p>Suddenly, Mo Fan realized he was in big trouble.</p><p>"Eh~~~"</p><p>Not far away, under the floorboards, the one-eyed demon wolf slowly turned its head. Its lantern-like eye directly locked onto Zhou Min and Mo Fan's position.</p><p>In an instant, the air seemed to freeze.</p><p>Even hidden behind brick walls, Mo Fan and Zhou Min could feel the chilling killing intent emitted by that ferocious one-eyed demon wolf.</p><p>A gust of night wind blew past, carrying a thick smell of blood, which slapped against Mo Fan and Zhou Min's cheeks.</p><p>Zhou Min was in shock; she never would have thought that the one-eyed demon wolf would suddenly discover their whereabouts. When she met its gaze, it felt as if she had fallen into the depths of fear, unable to move an inch.</p><p>"Auntie, didn't your mom teach you that demons have the ability to sense mobile signals?!!" Mo Fan grabbed Zhou Min and ran towards the construction site exit with lightning speed.</p><p>The creatures in this world were most unpredictable because they could sense magic technology device signals. So, silencing your phone and sending a distress message to the city monster hunting team was like giving the demons a GPS signal straight to their brains—they would be exposed in seconds!</p><p>"Eh~~~~~~~~~~~!!!"</p><p>Fortunately, Mo Fan and Zhou Min were at a distance from the creature; otherwise, they would have become the one-eyed demon wolf's midnight snack the moment they were discovered.</p><p>Mo Fan ran extremely fast, while casting Star Trails continuously.</p><p>This technique was something he had learned during his previous encounters with the monster hunting team. If a magician stood still and cast Star Trails like an idiot, any demon could grab an object and throw it at your head, resulting in instant death!</p><p>"Fire Blaze? Burn Bones!"</p><p>"BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The outer construction site fence, as flimsy as foam, was instantly shattered by the One-Eyed Monster Wolf's robust body. Mo Fan and Zhou Min, who had just escaped to the old district, turned around to see the One-Eyed Monster Wolf still chasing them, leaving them dumbfounded.</p><p>Damn it, this One-Eyed Monster Wolf! I've already entered the tower; what do you want??</p><p>Mo Fan initially thought that the One-Eyed Monster Wolf was somewhat intelligent, knowing how to hide in unoccupied construction sites to sneakily eat homeless people. Therefore, he deduced that the One-Eyed Monster Wolf wouldn't dare easily venture into the district, as being discovered would make it a target for everyone's pursuit. Who knew this One-Eyed Monster Wolf was completely unintelligent, chasing them right out of the construction site.</p><p>Brother Wolf, committing violence in broad daylight won't get you off scot-free, even though it's now nighttime and there are hardly any people in the old district. Someone will still see and report it... How about we part ways nicely today? Just go around this corner and split up; neither of us should look back.</p><p>Mālégēbì, if you keep chasing me, don't blame me for being ruthless!!</p>
