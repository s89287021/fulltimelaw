						<p>"Sorry, I'm late. Is Xu Dahang okay??" A middle-aged man in a dark blue shirt stood proudly on the roof of an old house, with a slowly fading star map beneath his feet, incredibly bizarre.</p><p>It was clearly this person, Yang Zuohé. He should be the nearest mid-rank mage here. Fortunately, Xu Dahang and Guo Caitang had notified everyone in time.</p><p>Yang Zuohé also glanced nervously at the bustling commercial street just a few buildings away from him. From his vantage point, he could see people still shopping, completely unaware of the danger.</p><p>If this one-eyed werewolf were to successfully advance and cross those buildings, that commercial district would turn into a hell on earth!</p><p>Yang Zuohé had worked for the Bole City Magic Association for many years and had seen all sorts of mages. Recently, Xu Dahang's monster-hunting squad had bravely tried to stop the one-eyed werewolf despite knowing it was in its advancement period. Such bravery was truly admirable!</p><p>"His chest is torn open, but his internal organs are fine, and he's still alive. Thank heavens." Li Wenjie tightly held Xu Dahang, who was bleeding profusely from his chest.</p><p>To be honest, Li Wenjie couldn't fully understand his captain. Didn't a mage's life matter just as much as others'?</p><p>"I've sent a healing mage here to stop Xu Dahang's bleeding. I'll deal with this beast!" Yang Zuohé said.</p><p>With that, Yang Zuohé suddenly flashed away. Mo Fan only saw a green star trail left behind before he disappeared and quickly approached the one-eyed werewolf far away.</p><p>Mo Fan subconsciously followed the mid-rank mage and finally found the one-eyed werewolf covered in debris at the end of the street.</p><p>Mid-rank magic was indeed more powerful than any basic-level magic. The helpless one-eyed werewolf was reduced to a half-dead old dog under the impact of the wave.</p><p>Thinking about it, those fierce waves would definitely break some bones, and after such rolling, soaking, and crashing, even the mightiest creature would turn into a pool of mush.</p><p>Yang Zuohé clearly didn't intend to let this nearly catastrophic one-eyed werewolf off easily. He used wind tracks to land in front of it.</p><p>"Wind Disc!"</p><p>The sound of magic echoed again, and Yang Zuohé transformed from a water mage into a wind mage wielding hurricane power.</p><p>First, the air became suffocatingly heavy.</p><p>Suddenly, the air around them seemed to be sucked away by something, swirling wildly.</p><p>Not far away, Mo Fan had just arrived and witnessed this middle-aged magician in a blue shirt using one hand to forcefully lift an immobile monoculus wolf. The dazzling star chart that shone beneath his feet and above his head was so beautiful and soul-stirring!!</p><p>"Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!"</p><p>It wasn't the gentle breeze of wind currents or merely the wind tunnel that accelerated speed; at this moment, Mo Fan could clearly feel the turbulent air swirling rapidly in front of him.</p><p>Very soon, a horrifying tornado appeared before his eyes.</p><p>The wind tornado forcefully dragged the immobilized monoculus wolf into the air, tracing several swirling arcs and throwing it over twenty meters high.</p><p>Just as Mo Fan was stunned by the tornado, it swiftly dissipated.</p><p>Without the power of the wind tornado, the monoculus wolf, resembling a small animal, fell heavily from the sky!!</p><p>"Bang!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The cement ground caved in, revealing countless spider cracks.</p><p>The monoculus wolf shattered into pieces, blood splattering everywhere.</p><p>Throughout this, the creature never let out any triumphant roars or howls; it was thoroughly turned into a pitiful-looking corpse under the two intermediate-level magic spells.</p><p>"Dead??" Mo Fan said with disbelief.</p><p>"It is dead," Yang Zuohé smiled reassuringly upon seeing Mo Fan approach.</p><p>"C-Can I go take a look?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"You can. Oh, if I'm not mistaken, that lightning imprint was cast by you, right?"</p><p>"It's me."</p><p>"You did a great job, young man. The Magic Association will work with the Hunter Alliance and the government to give you an award," Yang Zuohé patted Mo Fan on the shoulder.</p><p>Mo Fan approached the mangled one-eyed magic wolf and slowly extracted the small mudfish pendant from his collar opening.</p><p>The small mudfish pendant had a very strong reaction when facing this recently deceased one-eyed magic wolf, as if it were calling out to something by tapping some unheard rhythm...</p><p>A wisp of wolf spirit slowly drifted out of the one-eyed magic wolf's mouth.</p><p>Mo Fan could see this wolf spirit; it looked like a tiny firefly startled and floating up from the grass, unsure where to go.</p><p>The small mudfish pendant glimmered, and the wolf's soul seemed to find its destination, immediately drifting here...</p><p>The small mudfish pendant directly absorbed this wolf spirit and emitted a tremulous hum, like a well-fed child happily murmuring.</p><p>"This one... doesn't seem to be a residual spirit," Mo Fan suddenly realized something after the small mudfish pendant absorbed the one-eyed magic wolf's soul.</p><p>Previously, the residual spirits that the small mudfish pendant had absorbed were almost invisible firefly lights and exceptionally murky. The pendant could only barely absorb them, as if it was better off without them.</p><p>But this time, the small mudfish pendant had eagerly awaited from afar and happily devoured the one-eyed magic wolf's soul...</p><p>Could it be... a refined spirit???</p><p>Guo Haitang mentioned earlier that this one-eyed magic wolf had secretly absorbed the enormous energy of Bog City's holy spring while hiding in human cities to secretly advance. This meant the creature had been nourished by good things, becoming incredibly powerful and even reaching an advanced level.</p><p>Such demons had a high probability of leaving refined spirits after death!</p><p>Since only necromancer mages could collect refined spirits, even this mid-level mage Yang Zuohé couldn't see the pure firefly light refined spirit without special equipment.</p><p>Death creatures' refined spirits would dissipate on their own within about three minutes. Clearly, Yang Zuohé had never collected souls and showed no interest in corpses.</p><p>It is unlikely that this mid-rank mage would have thought the boy following him carried a receptacle for soul collection. Just as he turned to instruct others to handle the scene, Mo Fan, who looked somewhat harmless, had taken away the Essence Soul worth five million yuan!</p><p>The corpse of an eyeless wolf on the verge of advancing in rank is quite valuable, but it pales in comparison to the rare Essence Soul that appeared with such a small probability!!</p>
