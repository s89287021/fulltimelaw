						<p>"Ice Vines!"</p><p>Without any pause, without the slightest interruption, Mu Bai delivered his meticulously practiced performance flawlessly.</p><p>His pupils changed color as he exhaled the magical breath, and suddenly noticed that the puppet was covered in white frost!</p><p>The frost quickly spread, enveloping the entire puppet like it had been painted with ice paint, looking extraordinarily astonishing.</p><p>The coldness spread freely, permeating the entire examination hall.</p><p>"Creak~~ creak~~~ creak~~~~"</p><p>The Ice Vines did not end after covering the puppet; they actually began to spread across the exam room floor.</p><p>Another class also had an Ice Mage who had passed the Ice Vine skill test. His Ice Vines were clearly not as impressive as Mu Bai's!</p><p>All the students retreated in fear, feeling that the Ice Vines might spread to their area.</p><p>The school leaders and examiners remained calm; a look of approval flashed across their eyes.</p><p>This was a relatively mature Ice Vine skill, one that would pass even at the Mage Association.</p><p>The Mage Association is designed for adults, and it's truly remarkable that a student who has only awakened their magic abilities for a year could complete such a mature Ice-based skill.</p><p>"Not bad." Mu Zhuoyun still made this assessment.</p><p>Mu Bai did not know if he had met with Mu Zhuoyun's approval, his heart filled with trepidation as he turned his gaze to Mu Ningxue.</p><p>Upon looking, Mu Bai felt like he had been shot in the heart; her beloved Mu Ningxue was not even giving him a glance, instead fixating on someone in the class.</p><p>Mu Bai also followed her gaze, his heart feeling another pang.</p><p>Mo Fan!!</p><p>She was looking at Mo Fan!!</p><p>Damn it, damn it!!</p><p>Why is she looking at him again??</p><p>That guy, who should have been buried in the trash heap, has what to be attractive? Why isn't she watching me with my outstanding release??</p><p>Mu Bai's face twisted almost out of shape.</p><p>At such a crucial moment in his life, he hoped for Mu Ningxue's attention, but she still looked at that little punk. That little punk was just an ugly clown who amused the princess. What is there to be attractive about an ugly clown? Why waste your precious gaze on him after making her laugh??</p><p>"I'll make you suffer terribly!" Mu Bai's face darkened to the extreme, carrying his deep resentment as he walked out of the exam hall.</p><p>"The performance was outstanding, Stardust score S, Release grade B," the examiner gave the final scores.</p><p>In terms of release, even the top students were only C and D level. The only one who reached grade B was that lightning mage Xu Zhaoting!</p><p>This result deservedly made him the number one in the entire school.</p><p>...</p><p>"Next up, Mo Fan!"</p><p>While people were marveling at Mu Bai's glorious victory, it finally came to Mo Fan's turn.</p><p>In fact, Mo Fan was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Why does the green tea guy get done and then it's my turn? Was this all meticulously planned??</p><p>Mofan certainly didn't believe in such coincidences in the world.</p><p>However, it didn't matter. He would eat when hungry and sleep when tired, blocking any obstacles as they came. If he did nothing, it would simply be a clear day.</p><p>...</p><p>"How?" Mu He asked softly as Mu Bai approached him.</p><p>"I've done exactly as you said," Mu Bai replied maliciously, like a resentful woman.</p><p>"I was doing what's best for the Mo family. Directly expelling his son would save this father from further worry and stress. The boy wasn't meant to study magic in the first place; he insisted on joining in." Mu He explained.</p><p>Mu He and Mu Bai naturally had their ways of dealing with Mofan.</p><p>Before the exam, Mu He had meticulously planned everything using his position as a board member.</p><p>The bald examiner was one of Mu He's men. Mu He also arranged the order of student exams.</p><p>Right after Mu Bai finished his exam, it would be Mofan's turn to take the test. After Mofan's exam, there would be a break and the announcement of half the exam results, providing ample time for them to pull off a perfect manipulation. For example, when Mu Bai placed his hand on the Stardust Stone, they could place a Dark Stone underneath it.</p><p>The function of this Dark Stone was simple: it would absorb some of the energy emitted by the Stardust Stone, greatly dimming its glow.</p><p>Thus, even if Mofan managed to scrape through with a C grade, this tiny Dark Stone could easily lower his grade to a D or even lower.</p><p>Since he was already a failure, what difference did it make to let him fail completely? Such a person wasn't worth wasting the school's resources on. Getting rid of him early would be beneficial for both the school and his family.</p><p>Mu Bai had already twisted his face into a smile.</p><p>This time, wouldn't you, Mofan, embarrass yourself completely?</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan, he seems familiar." At this moment, Mu Zhuoyun slowly spoke.</p><p>"Brother, he is the son of Lady Mu's driver," Mu He timely reminded Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>At this time, Mu Ningxue, whose eyes were as cold as ice and snow all along, showed some movement in her gaze.</p><p>In fact, she had recognized Mo Fan long ago, but she was also puzzled about why she just happened to arrive here when it was the test between Mu Bai and Mo Fan.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun glanced at Mu Ningxue beside him.</p><p>Mu Ningxue quickly regained her usual calmness, looking at those ordinary students as before without any emotional fluctuations.</p><p>A look of satisfaction appeared in Mu Zhuoyun's eyes.</p><p>Children always have their moments of being unruly or rebellious, but they won't be so immature when they grow up.</p><p>"Take a look. He was once part of our Mu family," Mu Zhuoyun said calmly.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun knew very well that the son of a driver could not shine in any way, and it was good for Mu Ningxue to see him. Such ordinary people in Big City B were numerous and would soon fade out of their world. He did not want such a boy to leave any scars on his precious daughter's heart.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, Mo Fan did not listen to what those people were babbling about.</p><p>He had already arrived at the Star Sensation Stone and placed his hand on it like everyone else.</p><p>"I actually appreciate having him; he helps me keep my spot at the bottom. Otherwise, I would be in a miserable situation," a mediocre student said.</p><p>"Little Third Brother, I feel the same way. No worries, let's all leave campus with flair," said Xiao Bin, his dormmate from the water system.</p><p>"It's uncertain whether 'd' can get it."</p><p>"Yes, he hasn't made any progress at all."</p><p>In the class, Zhou Min, who was also a Fire-type user, was watching Mo Fan.</p><p>"There's light, there's light..."</p><p>"The light seems very weak, why does it feel weaker than D-class?"</p><p>The radiance on the Star Sensory Stone was extremely shy, unable to project from within the stone.</p><p>However, the internal light seemed to have more breakthrough potential, as if it should be dazzling. Yet, it couldn't be released.</p><p>"Damn it, something's wrong."</p><p>"This light... doesn't seem like D!"</p><p>"Really? C-class??" Classmate Xiaobin was stunned; he couldn't believe that Mo Fan had actually activated a C-class Fire-type radiance on the Star Sensory Stone.</p><p>Didn't we agree to graduate with flair? Getting just a passing C is barely satisfactory.</p><p>Where's the trust between fellow underachievers??</p>
