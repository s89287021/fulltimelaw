						<p>"I guess after you taste the benefits of this stardust magical artifact, you will still be relentless in collecting essences. Conveniently, after your training period ends this quarter, we will take you on a two-month field trip outside the city. By then, when you see real demons, you will completely give up that idea," said Teacher Tang Yue.</p><p>"Field trip??" Mo Fan had never heard of such a thing before. Could it be the legendary high school military training?</p><p>"Every mage has to go through this. Cultivating mages is not about pampering them or letting them compete with each other, but rather equipping them to fight demons when needed. This field trip is a major test of your students' mental fortitude," said Teacher Tang Yue.</p><p>"I will take it seriously."</p><p>"No," Tang Yue said, "The field trip is not a test per se; I only hope that you and the other students can stay calm in situations and think about how to survive."</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue finished her speech and turned to leave. Mo Fan tried to ask for more details but found that Tang Yue's curvaceous figure slowly merged into the shadowy area unlit by moonlight, after which she vanished without a trace.</p><p>Mo Fan had seen it clearly this time.</p><p>She truly blended into the darkness, vanishing completely as if she had never appeared.</p><p>Mo Fan hurriedly jumped down from the dam and stuck his head out from the railing on the rooftop.</p><p>What startled Mo Fan was that Teacher Tang Yue, who had just been on the eighth-floor teaching building rooftop, was now below him, walking slowly towards the teacher's apartment. The dim moonlight elongated her silhouette, making her look like a solitary night spirit.</p><p>As Teacher Tang Yue blended into the chaotic shadow cast by the trees, Tang Yue, who had been visible to Mo Fan, suddenly vanished again, leaving not a trace of this mysterious female teacher in the misty night air.</p><p>What was that skill?</p><p>Among all the elemental systems Mo Fan knew, only the wind system could use wind tracks for rapid movement. In Mo Fan's opinion, that was already impressive, but Teacher Tang Yue seemed to perform an even more baffling magic, as if she could swiftly navigate through shadows.</p><p>She is simply cool with no friends; when will I be able to learn?</p><p>By the way, this Teacher Tang Yue seems extraordinary.</p><p>It's said one needs to reach the intermediate mage level to awaken a second element system. This means that Teacher Tang Yue is at least an intermediate mage.</p><p>It's no wonder so many more experienced practical teachers were replaced by Teacher Tang Yue; to many, a mid-level mage was already considered top-tier!</p><p>It seems that Teacher Tang Yue is quite the strong pillar... one needs to cling tightly to her!</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>"Did you hear? At the end of this training period, we'll start our Mage Apprenticeships."</p><p>"What is a Mage Apprenticeship?"</p><p>"It's going out into the wilderness."</p><p>"No way, I've heard since childhood that there are demons in the wild, ones that eat people raw; I'm not going."</p><p>"You have to go. This apprenticeship is related to college admissions and counts as an important subject."</p><p>"One apprenticeship, what's there to be afraid of? We are mages, if we encounter a demon, an Icevine can freeze it into an ice sculpture."</p><p>"But, they say demons are very powerful, the Demonology teacher has been emphasizing repeatedly that we must never face demons alone."</p><p>As Teacher Tang Yue said, after this training period ends, there will be a brutal wilderness apprenticeship. Unless something goes wrong, they will encounter real demons.</p><p>Demonology classes have always existed; teachers have been talking about demons for who knows how many years, but none of the students have ever seen a real demon. Even secretly watching videos of demons online is no different from watching American Godzilla movies.</p><p>This time, the students will finally get to see real demons. The news was released, and the whole school was abuzz with discussion.</p><p>The apprenticeships will start with the top class.</p><p>After the annual evaluation ended, the top class had basically mastered seven stars, and now, after more than half a year, everyone should be proficient in their respective skills.</p><p>Only students who master magical skills are allowed to undergo training at the school; ordinary people have no chance of defending themselves against demons. </p><p>...</p><p>Time flew quickly, and Mo Fan had cultivated his lightning-star technique and fire-dust technique to about five or six times their initial levels with the help of his little mudskipper ring. </p><p>He could now release both the Lightning Seal and Fire Soak with great proficiency. </p><p>Due to open training at school, Mo Fan's Fire Soak was even faster, taking roughly three seconds to complete the entire casting process. The Lightning Seal, however, took nearly four seconds.</p><p>Currently, students in the top class generally needed 5 to 10 seconds to successfully cast a magical skill, making Mo Fan absolutely superior in this aspect.</p><p>The top class consisted of 100 students, divided into five groups of approximately twenty each.</p><p>Each group was accompanied by a teacher and led by two instructors. </p><p>Each small group had their own large bus, so the five school buses carried a crowd of young mages out to the city outskirts.</p><p>The route was roughly planned and would lead them to Snow Peak Mountain Station.</p><p>Snow Peak Mountain Station was an important outpost for communication between Hunter Alliance hunters and Bocheng Supply Corporation, located entirely within a valley.</p><p>"Remember what I told you, each city's surrounding station marks the boundary of the safe zone. Beyond the station lies territory where demons may appear. Until you have sufficient strength to deal with them, never venture beyond the station's boundary; otherwise, all that will remain is a pile of bones!" said Teacher Zhang Jianguo.</p><p>"Yes, within the station area, our Hunter Alliance, Magic Association, and other major magical families send personnel daily for patrols and security checks. We ensure no demon can enter human residential areas. However, our mages have limited power, capable only of protecting areas within the station boundary. Beyond it, we are powerless, as forests, valleys, wilderness, and mountain peaks create complex terrains where even powerful mages may struggle to eliminate demons hiding in caves or underground," said Lu Yunbo, the captain of Team Three.</p><p>Lu Yunbo was a handsome man with dark skin; several girls in his group were mesmerized by him, idolizing him like they did their military training instructors.</p><p>Lu Yunbo led this mission as an instructor.</p><p>The deputy instructor was a woman named Pan Lijun. She had a tough demeanor and dark skin, quite different from the young mage students still at school.</p>
