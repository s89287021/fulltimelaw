						<p>"Our Mu family recently obtained some fire attribute cultivation resources. Unfortunately, almost everyone in the estate is proficient in ice attribute cultivation. Your fire attribute talent is quite good, and your level of attainment has surprised us all. Therefore, I plan to give these resources to you. In addition to attending classes normally, you can practice with Mu Jiangming and his group," said Mu Zhuoyun as he stroked his beard.</p><p>These words were naturally spoken in front of everyone present.</p><p>From Mu Zhuoyun's perspective, this was also giving Mo Fan the utmost respect!</p><p>Among all the collateral branch descendants in the estate who were trying to impress him, he had not paid them much heed. For someone like Mo Fan, who did not even qualify as a proper descendant of the Mu family, to have such an opportunity was akin to jumping out of the barrel and into the kitchen!</p><p>In this society, there would always be exceptional cases where people could jump out of the barrel and into the kitchen. As the patriarch of the Zhuoyun branch of the Mu family, he could not afford to be shortsighted and only care about his own descendants.</p><p>"Big Brother, this… how can that be possible? Actually, Mu Bai has better talent. He may have been nervous today and didn't perform well, plus he is originally our collateral descendant…" Mu He was completely stunned, quickly addressing Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>Mu Bai, who had already felt as if his heart was pierced by a thousand arrows, was like a corpse being brutally whipped several times after hearing these words. The word 'suffering' could not even begin to describe it!</p><p>Damn, that was the opportunity he, Mu Bai, wanted most for inner disciple cultivation resources in the clan!</p><p>Mu Bai had spared no effort to shed his status as a collateral descendant and enter the core of the true descendants of the Mu family. Only then would he obtain more abundant cultivation resources and cease being a half-young master dependent on others.</p><p>He did not get it, and it was even obtained by the person he hated most in this world!</p><p>His corpse could come back to life from anger alone!</p><p>"I have already made this decision. You, Mu He, do not need to say anything more," Mu Zhuoyun waved his hand, maintaining that smile as he looked at Mo Fan.</p><p>What's wrong with you? Are you so happy you've gone crazy?</p><p>Haven't you thanked your benefactor yet?</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun was quite satisfied with himself for putting aside past grievances and recruiting a student with no status or position into the core of his Mu family. It seemed he was a magnanimous leader.</p><p>…</p><p>Mò Fán, what are you still staring at? Hurry up and thank Master Mu for his favoritism." The class teacher Schù Mùshēng hurriedly told Mò Fán.</p><p>Zhāng Xiǎohóu, Lù Xiǎobīn, Xǔ Qīnglín, and the others were all envious beyond measure.</p><p>Just a moment ago, Mò Fán was still a nobody who would be lost in a crowd, but now it seemed he was about to become a high-roller!</p><p>Mò Fán looked at Mu Zhuoyún, who had a faint smile on his face, his expression one of shock.</p><p>Mò Fán snapped out of it and smacked his lips.</p><p>After a while, Mò Fán finally spoke up: "Are you crazy?"</p><p>"What did you say?" Mu Zhuoyún was filled with confusion; he couldn't quite hear what the kid had said.</p><p>"I said, are you crazy!" Mò Fán repeated each word of his previous statement.</p><p>Everyone heard those words clearly, but their expressions were more confused than ever.</p><p>What on earth???</p><p>Are you crazy???</p><p>He's saying that Master Mu Zhuoyún is crazy??</p><p>My god, this guy Mò Fán must be insane!!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyún had now heard him clearly. He blew out his beard fiercely, anger in his voice as he said, "Your next words better have a perfect explanation, otherwise…"</p><p>"An explanation? Of course." Mò Fán nodded and spoke, "Don't pretend you didn't bully my family three years ago with your high moral stance; I'm not some idiot who would be loyal to you after getting slapped and then a bit of sugar. Three years ago, the things you said to me and my father, treating us like dogs, I remember them clearly while you have a bad memory. Let me tell you this old fool, don't even think about dragging me into your family now. Even if you were to bring Mu Níngxuě, along with her dowry, to beg me to join your family, I wouldn't care! Damn, do you really think the whole world revolves around the Mu Clan? Do you expect me to be filled with gratitude towards you? Apart from being crazy, I can't think of what's wrong with you today!"</p><p>This tirade seemed to have released all the anger and resentment Mò Fán had been harboring for years, flowing out effortlessly like a smooth river!!</p><p>The principal, the dean of discipline, that Director Deng Kai, Mu He, Mu Bai, Zhao Kunsan, class teacher Xue Mussheng, students from Class Eight, and Mu Ningxue herself were all stunned.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun's face darkened to an extreme!</p><p>"Creak~~ Creak~~~~ Creak~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Anger materialized. A solid crystal ice block abruptly formed beneath Mu Zhuoyun's feet, the coldness spreading in the air just like the surge of anger inside him!!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun was enraged, truly enraged!</p><p>It had been too many years since anyone dared to speak to him this way. Calling him the emperor of Bow City would not be an overstatement. Among his peers, high-ranking officials such as the principal of the magic school and the high council members of the Magic Association all treated him with deference. The younger generation in the entire estate could hardly even breathe in front of him. Who on earth gave this young punk Mo Fan and this brat the courage to speak to him like this?!!</p><p>Aura!!</p><p>A terrifying cold ice aura!!</p><p>Centered around Mu Zhuoyun, the sandy surface of the playground froze into solid ice crystals within a few seconds!</p><p>The chill permeated everything, turning the hot summer into winter in an instant, and transforming the training ground into a frozen landscape as vast as a mirror.</p><p>This awe-inspiring scene made all the students scream in terror!!</p><p>The playground instantly turned into ice without Mu Zhuoyun casting any magic; he froze everything just by his aura alone. What kind of cultivation level was this?</p><p>Compared to Mu Bai's tiny ice vines earlier, Mu Zhuoyun was like a giant, incomparable.</p><p>"Zhuoyun, control your emotions. This is a school, and there are many students here who lack defensive abilities," Director Deng Kai from the Hunter Alliance suddenly stepped forward, blocking Mu Zhuoyun and Mo Fan.</p><p>Deng Kai's intervention slightly weakened Mu Zhuoyun's terrifying power, but those around him were still so shocked that they could hardly breathe.</p><p>With Deng Kai standing up, even Teacher Tang Yue, one of the few people who could move freely in the crowd, stopped moving.</p><p>Tang Yue would not allow Mu Zhuoyun to harm her students, even if she herself might not be a match for the patriarch of that ice-elemental family.</p><p>——————————————</p><p>(Tell everyone some good news; this time, I promise not to keep you waiting.)</p><p>Starting tomorrow, we will update three chapters daily of "Full-Time Mage"!!</p><p>The update times are basically... well, it's somewhat disrespectful of update times for someone like me to dictate them, but I shall still set one officially:</p><p>Chapter 1: 12 PM</p><p>Chapter 2: 6 PM</p><p>Chapter 3: Midnight</p><p>Also, my fellow brothers and sisters at Qidian, I know you all have quite a few recommendation votes; please vote some for our new book. Voting for the old books repeatedly is boring; let's give our new book a chance on the charts, cause some chaos or something, as you all love watching the show, right? Hurry up and use your... uh, not your monthly votes, but your recommendation votes~~~~~</p><p>Sigh, I feel like there's no author in this world who begs for monthly votes even for their public chapters as much as I do.</p>
