						<p>A burst of flaming wave instantly shattered the jaws of the shadow wolf beast, revealing severe deformation in its jawbones. The intense flames quickly engulfed it. </p><p>The remaining inferno did not cease; instead, it ruthlessly invaded the shadow wolf beast's esophagus, filling its stomach and causing its lungs to swell up as if they were about to burst.</p><p>"BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>Finally, a loud explosion echoed, transforming the ferocious shadow wolf beast into a roasted corpse under the Blaze Blast. Its body fell heavily before Bai Yang.</p><p>Bai Yang's snarling face froze in shock, his entire demeanor turning ominously grim.</p><p>The bloodline of his previous shadow wolf beast was even more superior; it could have been cultivated into an incredibly powerful summoning creature. However, it had been accidentally killed by a junior student. That kill might have been a stroke of luck, but this time, the shadow wolf beast was directly obliterated by two formidable elemental spells.</p><p>"I admit that you are very different from most students who become weak-kneed upon seeing demons; you are not worse than some seasoned hunt mages. However, you must die. I will certainly use your corpse to nourish my next summoning creature!" Bai Yang gasped, his pale face twitching with agony.</p><p>Bai Yang had underestimated this student; a Thunder Seal Strike and a Blaze Blast might have severely injured the shadow wolf beast, but they would not normally be enough for a direct kill. This student had inserted Blaze Blast into the shadow wolf beast's mouth, instantly killing it—a tactic that was far beyond what an ordinary student could think of or execute!</p><p>Nevertheless, the death of the shadow wolf beast was irrelevant. After capturing the Sacred Spring, Bai Yang's status would change dramatically, and he would quickly grow indifferent to such a small creature.</p><p>"You two, kill it!!" Bai Yang's eyes turned cold as he viciously ordered the two black beasts.</p><p>The black beasts had been chasing after others but immediately turned towards Mo Fan upon receiving their master's command.</p><p>These black beasts were far more agile than the shadow wolf beast; they could jump on vehicle roofs and use vehicles for cover, constantly changing positions.</p><p>Clearly, these black beasts understood how to coordinate in hunting. They positioned themselves on either side of Mo Fan. Even if Mo Fan used the Thunder Seal skill to suppress one of them, the other would undoubtedly pounce before him, slicing open his throat!!</p><p>The two black beasts were closing in fast. Without the protection of a scythe shield, Mo Fan could only complete one magical star track.</p><p>Time did not permit Mo Fan to think much; instinctively, he tried to gather another Blaze Blast.</p><p>The explosive effect of Blaze Blast might allow him to narrowly escape, but it was uncertain whether he could handle these two extremely fast black beasts afterward.</p><p>"Teacher Xue, unleash the Radiance!" Mu Bai shouted from a distance at Xue Mussheng.</p><p>Xue Mussheng glanced at Mu Bai and noticed a blue glow of stardust rapidly gathering in his palm. With his extensive experience, Xue Mussheng immediately understood and without hesitation, cast his Light Magic.</p><p>Radiance of Blindness!</p><p>If released properly, this immense blinding light could burn out the eyes of a demon, rendering it combat ineffective.</p><p>Feeling the intense light, Bai Yang slowly turned away, adding a touch of disdain to his face.</p><p>This radiance had no real destructive power; one just needed to avoid staring directly at it to recover vision quickly. As for his two black beast demons, stop playing around; they were dark creatures without eyes and thus unaffected by this blinding radiance.</p><p>"Ice Blade Slash!"</p><p>A voice echoed from behind Bai Yang, and the next second, an intense cold sensation emanated from behind his neck.</p><p>Bai Yang was actually quite clever; without any summoned creatures around him, he had already positioned himself beside a car, allowing him to avoid being ambushed by the other students. However, that black ice sword did not care about obstacles in front of it, ruthlessly cleaving the vehicle into two pieces and simultaneously slashing Bai Yang's shoulder diagonally!</p><p>The blade was sharp and powerful, completely severing Bai Yang's upper body from his left shoulder down.</p><p>Not a drop of blood was left; the cut on his body had frozen over with frost. Bai Yang slowly fell to the ground, his face fixed in disbelief as he looked up at the sky.</p><p>He, a mage controlling three summoned creatures, had actually been killed by this student who would wet his pants at the sight of demons just a year ago??</p><p>Demon-slaying tool, why did an unfinished student possess such an immensely valuable magic tool and strike so suddenly that he didn't even have a chance to use his defensive magic tool.</p><p>Xue Mussheng's radiance began to fade. Mo Fan saw in the somewhat blinding light that the two black beast demons had suddenly stopped moving.</p><p>It felt as if his throat was being choked, and the two black beast demons writhed in pain on the spot. What puzzled Mo Fan even more was that their black bodies seemed to have encountered something extremely hot, melting bit by bit.</p><p>Within just five seconds, the two originally ferocious black beast demons by Mo Fan’s sides turned into puddles of black pus, with nauseating bubbles rising from them.</p><p>"The black beast demons are connected to their masters' souls; when the master dies, they are also destroyed. That's why they are the most loyal evil dogs for the Black Cathedral," Xue Mushi wiped the sweat off his forehead and said slowly.</p><p>Others gradually walked over from afar, glanced at Bai Yang’s corpse, then looked at the two puddles of pus, their faces filled with fatigue.</p><p>"My uncle finally put that demon-slaying tool he gave me on my eighteenth birthday to good use," Mu Bai said with a bitter smile when everyone was looking at him.</p><p>A demon-slaying tool was a typical offensive magical device; once activated, it could unleash the power of a massive slash, consuming a tremendous amount of mana. Such weapons were even more expensive than armor-type magical devices, and not even magicians could afford them, let alone ordinary people.</p><p>The last thing Bai Yang expected was that one of his students would have a demon-slaying tool. After all, no family would hand such a weapon to an ungraduated student.</p><p>In any case, Mu Bai’s demon-slaying tool had saved everyone; otherwise, they might not have been able to deal with the two extremely fast black beast demons.</p><p>——————————</p><p>(Two chapters today, this is Chapter 1. Also, Nǐmá, Xiamen is really hot.)</p>
