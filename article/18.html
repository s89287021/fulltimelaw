						<p>"Mo Fan, do you have the nerve to stand there? An entire semester has passed, and you haven't managed to control a single fire elemental star. Your stardust is so faint it can barely be seen. Stop messing around, okay!" Zhao Kunsan said immediately.</p><p>There was an exam at the end of last semester to test the students' progress in cultivation. As expected, Mo Fan's fire elemental stardust hadn't improved much since he first awakened it. The whole class knew this, and it had made both Zhao Kunsan and Mu Ba crack up!</p><p>Fools are fools; awakening a fire elemental talent is useless if you can't use it. He'll never become a mage in his lifetime.</p><p>"Your fire elemental talent is quite good, but why is your cultivation so weak? Mo Fan, many people aspire to become fire mages, and you already have an advantage that most don't. You need to work hard," Miss Tang said, looking at Mo Fan with a touch of regret.</p><p>"I understand, Miss Tang," Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>After meditative practice, a mage's mental strength grows immensely, allowing them to perceive details that ordinary people cannot, including the auras of other mages.</p><p>The strength of an aura can roughly indicate a mage's level of cultivation.</p><p>One cannot hide their cultivation level, and Mo Fan had known this for a long time.</p><p>However, there was one thing: if Mo Fan concealed his lightning elemental power and only revealed his fire elemental aura, others could only sense the fire elemental aura and judge his proficiency in it, without detecting any other elemental power.</p><p>Therefore, Mo Fan could always use his fire elemental abilities to mislead people!</p><p>"Now that I'm starting to learn about the fire element, such an accomplished fire mage teacher has arrived. It seems I have a good chance of mastering the basic skill Fire Dew before the major exam," Mo Fan's confidence soared instantly.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Why is this girl staring at me with such a strange expression?</p><p>Is she called Zhou Min? The top student in the class and a fire elemental too.</p><p>Mo Fan was puzzled. He didn't think he had offended this girl named Zhou Min, so why did she look at him with such an unfriendly gaze?</p><p>On the other side, Zhou Min frowned as she saw that Mo Fan, the underachiever, was also looking at her. She immediately glared fiercely at him.</p><p>Zhou Min was very unhappy.</p><p>Why did this Mo Fan have a better Fire affinity than herself?</p><p>Class teacher Xue Musheng had said that Mo Fan had the best Fire affinity in the class, with obvious flames appearing when he awakened it. Now even the very capable Teacher Tang Yue also said that his talent was good.</p><p>Forget it, there was no need to get angry at this unambitious underachiever. Anyway, those who failed the annual assessment would be directly expelled from school, and this guy only had half a year of freedom left.</p><p>She really couldn’t understand why, given that he came from a poor family and had to sell pots and pans to afford Tianlan Magic High School, he still remained so energetic and diligent after awakening his Fire affinity. Did he deserve it for his family? Was his conscience eaten by a dog?</p><p>Thanks to Zhao Kun San and Mu Bai, most of the class knew that Mo Fan was forced into the class.</p><p>"Teacher Xue, your class teacher, has already mentioned the importance of the annual assessment. Firstly, students who fail will be expelled from school, and secondly, those with excellent and average grades will be reassigned to different classes. Students placed in the advanced class will receive special attention, giving them a greater advantage for applying to magic universities. Therefore, there is no reason not to work hard this semester," Teacher Tang Yue said.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, will you teach us in the advanced class?" asked a male student.</p><p>"Hmm, assuming everything goes as planned, I will be teaching practical classes for the advanced class after finishing with you all," Tang Yue nodded slightly.</p><p>"Teacher, I am Yang Guo… oh, I mean Huang Feifeng. I will definitely work harder!"</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, I want to follow you in the future too."</p><p>Tang Yue maintained a gentle smile; it was clear that her first lesson had been quite successful, and she had sparked her students' enthusiasm for learning.</p><p>"That's right, if anyone can already completely control all seven stars, feel free to come find me privately. I will set aside personal time to tutor you," Tang Yue continued.</p><p>"Aooooooooooooo~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A howl suddenly echoed through the class!</p><p>Seven stars became everyone's goal overnight.</p><p>"I'm almost there, Ms. Tang Yue, wait for me..."</p><p>"Really? How many have you got?"</p><p>"Two."</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>"Three? You dare show off here? I already have nearly four, it gets harder the more stars you get, don't you understand!"</p><p>Xu Qinglin said with disdain.</p><p>"Damn, is Mu Bai that good?!"</p><p>"F...Five stars, how did you cultivate that, so awesome!"</p><p>"I heard the most talented student in class Seven, a lightning-type genius, only has five stars."</p><p>Feeling his classmates' conversations, Mu Bai felt somewhat elated.</p><p>However, in order to demonstrate his maturity and composure, Mu Bai wouldn't show on his face the kind of intoxication from being praised; that would make him look very childish.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan was a bit stupid and unreliable, but he had one very perceptive trait: whenever his master couldn't bring himself to brag but still needed everyone's attention, Zhao Kunsan would step in at just the right moment.</p><p>It wouldn't do for Mu Bai to jump out and say "I've got five stars" every time others discussed "three" or "two", and were surprised by someone with "four". That would be degrading. It didn't match his aristocrat's dignity. Having Zhao Kunsan say it was perfect!</p><p>This way, he could show off his awesomeness without losing his composure!</p><p>Life is like playing League of Legends; it's not just about being strong yourself, but also about your teammates knowing how to work together!</p>
