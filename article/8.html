						<p>As summer turned to autumn, leaves swirled in the wind and drifted into the school playground. </p><p>Beside the playground, a dense shade of green provided shelter, with afternoon sunlight filtering through the leaf gaps, creating dapples that resembled a special autumn stage.</p><p>For Mo Fan, time had passed swiftly; two months had elapsed since his awakening.</p><p>During these two months, Mo Fan did nothing but sit under this tree—meditating!</p><p>On the first day, in the very first class, Head Teacher Xue Musheng delivered an important lesson to all magic students: the release of magic!</p><p>The process of releasing magic consisted of just three simple steps.</p><p>First, meditation.</p><p>Second, control.</p><p>Third, release!</p><p>Meditation meant focusing one’s mind entirely on thought.</p><p>Even when eyes were closed, the brain continued to conjure various images.</p><p>However, if one did not think and was undisturbed, their mind became completely empty!</p><p>After a magician awakened, corresponding elemental stardust appeared in this world of emptiness.</p><p>This meant that whenever Mo Fan closed his eyes and allowed his mind to become as void as a black universe, lightning and fire stardust would appear within this mental void.</p><p>Lightning stardust was purple, resembling floating cosmic dust particles, beautiful and enchanting, dazzling in variety.</p><p>There were seven stars within the lightning stardust, moving erratically throughout the tiny cluster, like mischievous children with boundless energy running around inside.</p><p>For any awakened magic student, as long as they can conjure stardust out of nothingness and see the lively, sparkling stars within it, they have completed their meditation.</p><p>One could say that this first step is really simple, and for these two months, all the magic students were given only this homework to do at home.</p><p>Meditation began right after dinner and continued until exhaustion, after which they would go to sleep.</p><p>The next day, after finishing classes in the afternoon, they would meditate again, continuing until exhaustion before going to bed...</p><p>Mo Fan did not slack off; he followed through with this for two entire months, including weekends. Many times, he could not understand why his teachers had assigned such a simple task for so long.</p><p>"Maybe I should try taking control myself?" Mo Fan felt that he was already quite proficient in meditation, so he wanted to move on to the next step.</p><p>The second step of magic release is also very simple.</p><p>After entering meditation, one would see stardust, within which there are seven lively and energetic stars moving around irregularly.</p><p>Taking control means using one's mental intent to manage these stars, making them calm down and obediently stop at specific positions, forming a star trail.</p><p>Once the star trail is formed, magical power will be conducted through it into the mage's body, transforming into real magic and being released!</p><p>"The stars are moving so fast; let Daddy touch them." Mo Fan began to try communicating with the stars.</p><p>Using his intent to control the stars, Mo Fan had already locked onto a carefree star and was attempting to make it obediently stop in place.</p><p>"Whoosh~~~~~~"</p><p>That star was extremely aloof, ignoring Mo Fan completely. It seemed like a little girl who had encountered a monster, fleeing quickly!</p><p>"F*ck, so stubborn. Forget it, I'll try another one." Mo Fan started communicating with another lightning-type star.</p><p>"Little sweetie, Daddy's here, come over and listen..."</p><p>"Whoosh~~~~~"</p><p>The second star acted like a fugitive from a mental asylum, running incredibly fast.</p><p>Mo Fan tried controlling the other stars as well; they all reacted the same way, showing no regard for him. A few even ran faster when they sensed his intent to command them!</p><p>When the stars were spinning and racing, magical energy could not be transmitted.</p><p>It was like an electrical wire—electricity existed within the stardust, but to release it, the stars needed to form a line, transmitting the energy into the mage's body...</p><p>Unfortunately, none of these lightning-type stars obeyed orders. It was fine as long as he didn't try communicating with them, but once he attempted to, they ran off at breakneck speed, almost as if they had consumed five hundred pounds of Red Bull—there was no way to stop them!</p><p>"How am I supposed to learn this? When the hell will I master my Lightning Seal skill?" Mo Fan groaned in frustration.</p><p>The basic skill for the Thunder Magic system is precisely the Lightning Seal.</p><p>This skill should be one of the most practical among all basic magic abilities. Mastering it and gaining proficiency would basically grant exceptional combat power.</p><p>Unfortunately, skills are not so easily learned.</p><p>Lightning-type stars were highly active, and stopping them was far from something that could be accomplished in just a couple of days.</p><p>"Now I can barely control even one star; how am I supposed to manage seven at once... The path ahead is truly long."</p><p>Indeed, reading books and learning magic are not things that can be mastered in just a couple of days...</p><p>...</p><p>"Ah Qiu~~~~~~ Dammit, if I had flipped over the Fire Elemental Empress card first, maybe this winter wouldn't be so bad." Early in the morning, while practicing control on the rooftop, Mo Fan cursed aloud.</p><p>After more than a month of practice, Mo Fan was already able to control four stars.</p><p>The process of controlling the stars… well, it’s kind of like playing with high-difficulty dominoes.</p><p>That is to say, you need to place four dominoes carefully in one go without letting any of them wobble, and that counts as a small step forward.</p><p>If any of the star dominoes are not placed correctly, the whole thing will collapse, and you’ll have to start over!</p><p>Controlling stars requires you to first lock onto a star and use your mind to command it to stop. During this process, you must remain fully focused; even if the star’s mental resistance causes your head to hurt, you have to grit your teeth and hold on, without any distractions.</p><p>Only by gritting your teeth and concentrating intensely can you issue commands and resist the star. This is how you can make some irritable Thunder Stars listen and hover in place obediently.</p><p>Once a star listens to you, you must divide your focus again and do the same thing with another star, making sure it also listens and remains under control.</p><p>If you accidentally spend too much energy on the second star and forget to maintain control over the first one, the star that was just listening will fly away, taking the second star with it, and all your efforts will be wasted.</p><p>Teachers had mentioned before that controlling stars is extremely difficult. On one hand, it requires high levels of manipulation; on the other hand, mages need sufficient mental energy to expend.</p><p>Mo Fan felt drained every time he failed to control a star during his practice, and after practicing continuously for two hours, he would enter a state of mental collapse, experiencing tinnitus, blurred vision, and a complete disarray in his mind.</p><p>At such times, meditation or control practices were out of the question.</p><p>In short, practicing "control" is incredibly draining. One mana tube can only be used for up to two hours.</p>
