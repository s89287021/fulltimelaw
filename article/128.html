						<p>This Tang suit-clad man has clearly been at the intermediate level for quite some time. The fluidity of his movements far surpassed Mo Fan's. Most importantly, others relied on their own control to draw out star charts...</p><p>The three men dispersed, and a massive flaming fist shot out instantly. This tiny mountain range seemed unable to withstand the overwhelming power of the flames, trembling violently.</p><p>The heat waves surged even more fiercely, threatening to snap nearby trees as their crowns bent down within arm's reach...</p><p>The blazing giant fist collided recklessly, causing the hunters to scatter in fear. Only that cowboy man stood his ground without any intention of dodging, and even showed a hint of disdain in his eyes!</p><p>"Rock Barrier · Jagged Rock!"</p><p>The cowboy shouted loudly, pushing his palms forward fiercely!</p><p>Amidst the flames, a rock barrier appeared out of nowhere, forming an enormous jagged arc before this man!</p><p>This jagged rock wall resembled a protective mountain wall enclosing everyone, incredibly thick and unbreakable.</p><p>That powerful flaming fist, capable of blasting a large hole in rocks, left merely an indentation when it struck the rock wall. All the waves of flames could only roll along the curve of the rock wall, protecting those behind from any scorching heat!</p><p>Mo Fan's mouth gaped open at this scene.</p><p>He knew about the power of a flaming fist; the central blazing flames were sufficient to reduce building walls to ashes, and the following impact could destroy an ordinary house. However, when this powerful flaming fist slammed into that man’s rock wall, it was completely blocked. The cowboy facing the flaming fist remained unharmed, and neither did those behind him!</p><p>"Intermediate Rock Skill - Rock Barrier, one of the strongest defensive spells before the intermediate level." Teacher Tang Yue was quite competent; she quickly explained to Mo Fan, who was still unfamiliar with the intermediate realm.</p><p>"That’s a long posture." Mo Fan sighed.</p><p>At the beginner level, when everyone had only one skill, magic duels were almost like hand-to-hand combat—punch for punch. But at the intermediate level, with each person having four skills, battles between mages became more varied, with strategies to counter attacks and defense.</p><p>Although the hunter teams did not come from prestigious families, their team composition was very reasonable.</p><p>After the cowboy man completed his defense, the scar-faced man used the protection of this rock barrier to cast an intermediate wind spell.</p><p>"Feng Pan · Dragon Vortex"</p><p>For a moment, within the range of this small reservoir surrounded by hills, there was no sense of air movement; leaves did not stir, dust did not rise, and an inexplicable pressure made it feel as if all the oxygen had been sucked out of the area.</p><p>"Huhuhuhu~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A gale suddenly rose. The stifling heat that had pervaded just moments ago swiftly dissipated under this monstrous wind. Soon after, those standing in the reservoir could clearly sense that air currents from all directions were fiercely converging toward a specific region, gradually forming a terrifying dragon vortex at the most oppressive point of the entire area!</p><p>The dragon vortex lifted all the dust into an ominous, yellow serpentine body rising from the ground. Even the surrounding trees could not withstand this intense swirling force and seemed on the verge of being pulled up by their roots!</p><p>The wind lashed against Mo Fan's face, causing sharp pain, and he could barely see the state of the reservoir anymore. Only that monstrous Feng Pan · Dragon Vortex was wreaking havoc, stirring up chaos.</p><p>Mo Fan had experienced mid-level wind magic before; seeing it again now sent ripples through his heart. Compared to the initial wind track, this mid-level wind magic was like a tyrannosaurus rex, with equally terrifying destructive power!</p><p>After one vortex, the reservoir was completely transformed, with trees bending or falling and debris scattered everywhere.</p><p>In the midst of the chaos stood the four mages from the Dongfang Family. They seemed to have used some magical device to resist but were not entirely swept into the air; otherwise, they would likely have lost half their lives by crashing down.</p><p>They had managed to withstand the attack, though in a rather disheveled state. The man in Tang suit had an angry expression on his face.</p><p>The anger between both sides erupted completely, and the mages no longer held back as they unleashed their respective mid-level skills. Mo Fan and Tang Yue withdrew fifty meters or so to avoid being caught in the crossfire.</p><p>The battle lasted for ten minutes, with magical devices being revealed one after another. Ultimately, it was that man in the Tang suit who used a slaying device to shatter the scarred man's rock barrier defense, sending the hunter mage team flying far away.</p><p>Once one of them was breached, these hunters who relied on teamwork were taken down one by one by those four mid-level mages.</p><p>"I'm selling the Hunter Alliance a favor today. If you don't leave now, I'll burn all of you to ashes! Believe me, when the people from the Court of Judgment come, they won't find a single shred of evidence!" The man in the Tang suit roared in anger as a scorching golden light gathered on his palm!</p><p>Pan Xiong and company, despite feeling immense frustration, were powerless to resist any further.</p><p>It wasn't that their skills were inferior; it was just that these family mages were equipped with magical devices. They had finally managed to suppress the enemy through experience and casting techniques only for someone else's device to easily neutralize them!</p><p>At this point, the difference between the noble and grassroot mages was still very apparent.</p><p>"Let's go!" Pan Xiong gritted his teeth and immediately helped up his teammate who had been knocked unconscious by an explosion.</p><p>Fortunately, no one died directly. In fact, the Eastern Family members could have killed them, but they refrained out of fear of the Council of Judgment.</p><p>Fights over treasure among mages in the wild were not uncommon; many of these advanced mages had blood on their hands from battles with fellow mages. Compared to the fire element spirit, they still valued their own lives more.</p><p>The group quickly retreated without much hesitation, given their lack of combat capability.</p><p>Seeing the hunters leave, the four Eastern Family members who finally drove away the competition heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Damn, if they fought us to the death, we would have taken heavy losses. My Star Cloud is almost depleted," said the young man with hair that stood up like a playboy's.</p><p>"You're right; it was Brother Jun's calm demeanor that scared them off directly."</p><p>The man in Tang suit also looked rather tense. These hunters were accustomed to fighting demons and had far more combat experience than mid-tier mages living in cities. If not for the three elite members of noble families he brought today, they might have been defeated here. The Hunter Alliance was indeed formidable!</p><p>(Chapter Two will be uploaded at midnight~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Due to lack of saved drafts, updates may not be as timely as before and are likely to appear quietly around nightfall.)</p>
