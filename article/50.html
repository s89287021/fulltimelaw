						<p>Tang Yue, Zhang Jianguo, and Chen Weiliang were all stunned.</p><p>Commandant Zhankong had just flown into the cave at incredible speed; it was impossible for him to be killed by Zhankong.</p><p>So, how did the Shadow Wolf Beast die??</p><p>"The summoner's familiar will suffer certain mental and soul injuries when their familiar dies. The Shadow Wolf Beast seems to have really died," Tang Yue said.</p><p>From Bai Yang's appearance just now, it was clearly a symptom of a familiar's death; this could not be faked.</p><p>"Didn't the Shadow Wolf Beast chase Mo Fan into the cave?"</p><p>"Yes, how did it suddenly die?"</p><p>"Could it be that the cave was too dark and the Shadow Wolf Beast accidentally crashed into a rock?" Chen Weiliang said.</p><p>Bai Yang turned his face around, those eyes filled with an unprecedented level of venomous resentment.</p><p>You got yourself killed; your whole family deserves to die.</p><p>My Shadow Wolf Beast is not a dumb rabbit that would crash into stakes. The Shadow Wolf Beast has night vision and its physique is agile—how could it possibly die by crashing into rocks??</p><p>Even if all 40 students could cast spells, they might still not be able to kill my Shadow Wolf Beast!!!</p><p>"Let's go check it out," Teacher Tang Yue said.</p><p>"Yes, yes, let's hurry over there."</p><p>"Support will arrive soon to take these students back."</p><p>…</p><p>In the cave, </p><p>Chief Instructor Zhan Kongs still stood there in disbelief, unable to believe what he had just witnessed with his own eyes.</p><p>That student named Mo Fan was not dead; at that moment, he was carrying a wounded companion on his back.</p><p>The frenzied yao-beast wolf that should have been eliminated by him himself now stood below... or rather, it was impaled on a stalactite.</p><p>There were no signs of life left.</p><p>The yao-beast wolf was dead!</p><p>This yao-beast wolf's combat prowess was no less than that of a true demon. The purpose of Zhan Kongs releasing it here was definitely not for these students to defeat it; he only wanted it to pretend to be a demon and provide the students with a genuine test.</p><p>To defeat this yao-beast wolf??</p><p>This was an impossible task. Even a team of true hunters would have been wiped out by the demons, let alone these students who turned into quivering wrecks at the sight of demons.</p><p>So when he chased them here, Zhan Kongs only hoped that fewer students would die during the time it took him to eliminate the yao-beast wolf.</p><p>However, what he saw was something he could not believe even for a moment.</p><p>The yao-beast wolf was dead!</p><p>Impaled by a stalactite.</p><p>It was impossible for such a coincidence to happen in this world. It couldn't be that the stalactite had fallen on its own and happened to hit the frenzied yao-beast wolf. Moreover, given the yao-beast wolf's reaction, it should have been able to dodge before the stalactite fell.</p><p>"Y-You did it??" Chief Instructor Zhan Kongs was dazed for a long time before finally fixing his gaze on that student named Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan raised his head, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Wings!!</p><p>This chief instructor had wings!!</p><p>Wind Wings—Mo Fan knew it was Wind Wings, but he never imagined that real Wind Wings could be so soul-stirring.</p><p>That hovering figure, and those angelic-looking Wind Wings behind him… Damn, it was awesome!</p><p>"How did you do it?" Chief Instructor Zhan Kong still sounded somewhat incredulous as he asked.</p><p>As he spoke, Zhan Kong suddenly felt that his question might have been unnecessary.</p><p>From the various traces at the crime scene, it seemed that this student named Mo Fan had used Fire Darts to sever the stalactites, which then fell and pierced through the Demon Wolf Beast.</p><p>But Zhan Kong still had countless doubts and surprises in his heart.</p><p>Firstly, how calm did this student need to be to think of leading the Demon Wolf Beast into a cave and using stalactites as weapons? Secondly, how did he manage to make the Demon Wolf Beast stand still so that it could be pierced by the falling stalactites?</p><p>In short, he really found it hard to accept the fact that a senior student had single-handedly killed a Demon Wolf Beast that was even stronger than a demon!</p><p>"Chief Instructor, I happened to find this blue bracelet in the cave. Do you think I've completed the bounty? Where's my magical tool?" Mo Fan walked up to Chief Instructor Zhan Kong and showed him a smile.</p><p>Zhan Kong suddenly shook his head vigorously, finally realizing something!</p><p>Damn it!!</p><p>This instructor had not prepared any magical tools at all, right?!</p><p>This bounty was extremely challenging because the cave was guarded by a Shadowwolf Beast, and placing the blue bracelet there symbolically meant that it was impossible to expect these students to retrieve it.</p><p>In Zhankong's estimation, half of the students would be eliminated at previous checkpoints, and the remaining half would surely be wiped out by the Shadowwolf Beast!</p><p>He never expected … that an extraordinary student would actually kill the Shadowwolf Beast!</p><p>What kind of monster is this?!!</p><p>A Shadowwolf Beast, which even teachers and instructors could barely defeat, was actually killed by this student!!!</p><p>And what about the magic tool?</p><p>Magic tools were extremely expensive; how could Zhankong possibly send it away?</p><p>But now …</p><p>This student clearly completed the bounty.</p><p>Mofan looked at the head instructor, Zhankong, whose face had become incredibly strange, and he even reached out to take the magic tool.</p><p>"Cough cough… Save people first, save people first!" Finally, Head Instructor Zhankong said awkwardly.</p><p>"Oh, oh, that's right too… I remember you mentioned it was a defensive magic tool, worth several hundred thousand gold pieces for a defensive magic tool!" Mofan nodded in agreement.</p><p>As the head instructor, Zhankong, flew heroically with Wind Wings, his balance suddenly became unstable, and he almost didn't dodge the approaching stalactite…</p><p>Students, let's save people first!!!</p>
