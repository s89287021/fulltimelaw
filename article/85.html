						<p>Mo Fan's classmates Zhou Min, Zhao Kun San, Mu Bai, Zhang Xiao Hou, Wang San Pang, and others were rubbing their eyes frantically there. They must have read too many magic spells and gotten hallucinations; no way, they had to go back to school and do ten thousand test papers to calm down! Hallucinations appearing before the college entrance exam was not a good sign!!</p><p>The scene remained silent for a very long time!</p><p>As soon as the lightning seal appeared, it seemed that all the concepts everyone knew collapsed into chaos at that moment, and no one could speak for quite some time.</p><p>"Who... Who can... tell me what exactly... is going on!!" The man surnamed Zhou also stood up from his chair, sweeping his gaze across the stunned Big Figures of Bocheng who had been blasted by the lightning seal.</p><p>No one came forward to explain; did he really go blind alone??</p><p>"He's a mid-level mage. He awakened his second element, it must be that way!!" Xue Mu Sheng said with a tone of disbelief.</p><p>"No!" At this moment, Principal Zhu, who was the most authoritative, spoke up.</p><p>Everyone looked at Principal Zhu; they believed only the respected Principal Zhu could explain the unbelievable scene before their eyes that had blinded them.</p><p>"He is still an apprentice mage." Principal Zhu said with certainty.</p><p>"Then how can he possibly possess lightning... "</p><p>Principal Zhu took a deep breath; it was clear to see how agitated Bocheng's elder was, his facial muscles trembling in shock, and he had to pause to speak.</p><p>"He was born with dual elements. Mo Fan is... Mo Fan is born with... dual elements!!" Finally, Principal Zhu stated his most certain judgment amidst the shock.</p><p>Yes, it must be dual elements!</p><p>This student's level absolutely could not reach mid-level; the only explanation for him being able to cast the lightning seal skill was that he was born with dual elements!!</p><p>He awakened fire and also awakened lightning!</p><p>This student who had been born in his Tianlan Magic High School was an incomparably rare existence in this world—born with dual elements!</p><p>"Born with dual affinity, my heavens, does this world truly have someone born with dual affinities???"</p><p>"I... I don't know what to say anymore."</p><p>"Xue... Xue Museng, isn't Mo Fan your student? Didn't you host his awakening ceremony as well??" Director Chen Weiliang said to Xue Museng, who was stunned.</p><p>"It was me, but... but I clearly remember he only had a fire affinity." Xue Museng tried very hard to recall, but he really couldn't remember the scene clearly.</p><p>This shock made everyone forget that this was a duel between young mages. The news of Mo Fan's dual affinity overshadowed today's main event, Yuang Ang's coming-of-age ceremony. Tonight, no one could outshine or surprise anyone more than the revelation of Mo Fan's innate dual affinity!</p><p>"This brat... our military branch has him in our sights, whoever dares to challenge me, I'll burn down their house!!!"</p><p>Military leader Zhan Kong had already jumped up from his chair.</p><p>Who was he Dazhan Kong afraid of in Bo City? Whoever dared to challenge for this brat Mo Fan with dual affinity, Zhan Kong would destroy them.</p><p>Oh no, I got transferred here unexpectedly and thought it was going to be like that. Who knew this small city would produce such an extraordinary magical prodigy as Mo Fan. Even when Mo Fan only had a single fire affinity, Zhan Kong already had high hopes for him and wanted to recruit him into his military branch. Who knew this brat actually harbored such astonishing talent? He was determined, he would do whatever it takes, even bankrupting himself, to secure this brat!</p><p>The Zhou surnamed man originally intended to stand up and speak, but Zhan Kong's words left him dumbfounded.</p><p>Come on, no way! Our Zhou family wants him too!</p><p>The Zhou surnamed man now regretted not jumping out earlier to forcibly take this brat away. With the appearance of a dual affinity mage, all factions in Bo City would fight tooth and nail over this unrivaled prodigy without any affiliation yet!!!</p><p>"Boss Zhan Kong, although you have the final say on many matters in Bo City, that doesn't mean you can just take whatever you want. I'll report this to higher-ups; our Great Mage Association has never let go of any extraordinary genius, and we're even better than anyone else at cultivating mages."</p><p>Yang Zuoheshui jumped out immediately.</p><p>Small families or clans might have to give the military some face, but they didn't need to for the Great Mage Association.</p><p>Raid a family??</p><p>No power in this world dares to raid the Mage Association's property!!</p><p>"By the way, our school is actually quite willing to spend a hefty sum to nurture such students. You don't have to worry about it, uh-huh."</p><p>Principal Zhu also spoke up.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun stood there dumbfounded, watching all the guests who were shocked by Mo Fan, witnessing these major factions publicly tearing each other apart over this young Mo Fan. He also looked at the mage standing on the dueling platform, controlling dual-element lightning and fire magic.</p><p>His family’s Mu Ningxue also possessed an incredibly rare magical talent, but in terms of attractiveness, a naturally dual-element talent might be even more impressive. After all, Mu Ningxue was born with a Spirit-grade Ice Seed, which undoubtedly surpassed her peers; however, rich families and noble houses could still gather celestial materials to obtain such seeds. In contrast, this natural dual-element talent was as rare as finding a fish riding a bicycle!</p><p>He could say that he, Mu Zhuoyun, also wanted this boy???</p><p>"Quickly get up, Young Brother Jiaxing, quickly! I merely wanted to give your son a little lesson; how could I really do something so extreme?" Mu Zhuoyun hurriedly helped Mo Jiaying up.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun’s attitude had completely changed.</p><p>Mo Jiaying was lifted up, and he couldn’t believe his surroundings as he looked around.</p><p>Perhaps someone who drives a sports car might not know what a natural dual-element talent truly signifies, but seeing the expressions on the faces of these celebrities just now and their current competitive behavior made him realize how extraordinary his son was.</p><p>No, being extraordinary wasn’t enough to describe it; his son could probably shake up all of Bocity!!</p><p>It was really too good, really too good. He hadn’t regretted selling his only property to let his son enter Tianlan Magic High School at that time. If he had hesitated even a little back then, he would have stifled such an outstanding mage! Looking at these major figures in Bocity and their expressions, watching how they competed, heaven above, what merit did he, Mo Jiaying, have to give birth to such an extraordinary son??</p><p>Mo Jiaying wiped away his tears from extreme happiness. He stood up.</p><p>A busy life, low income, and a difficult environment had made him hunch over for a long time. Usually, bowing and scraping for these rich people in their sports cars was no different from kneeling… He understood why his son had asked him to stand up just now; from this moment on, they would absolutely no longer have to kowtow to anyone!!</p>
