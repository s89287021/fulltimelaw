						<p>The void of the spiritual world flickered with a faint light. Mo Fan focused intently, and suddenly noticed a tiny speck of stardust appearing within his emptiness.</p><p>Mo Fan was overjoyed!!!</p><p>This stardust was immensely important to mages; it served as a crucial indicator of their level. It resided in the mage's spiritual realm, with its presence occupying more space in the void signifying a higher level!</p><p>Within this stardust, Mo Fan could see something being illuminated—a small patch of purple stardust. Compared to the entire spiritual world, this speck was indeed minuscule like dust. However, it also meant that his awakening had not failed; the book clearly stated that possessing even the weakest stardust in one's spiritual world signified a successful awakening!!!</p><p>Hahahaha, who said I would fail in my awakening!</p><p>Didn't I just awaken successfully?</p><p>I really want to see Zhao Kun San and Mu Bai's twisted faces right now.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Wait, what color is this stardust?</p><p>It's not red; how disappointing, I didn't awaken as a fire mage.</p><p>Red stardust represents the fire element.</p><p>Blue stardust represents the wind element.</p><p>Brown stardust represents the earth element.</p><p>Blue stardust represents the water element.</p><p>Golden stardust represents the light element.</p><p>Purple stardust represents...</p><p>I kissed a blade!!!</p><p>Suddenly, Mo Fan froze in place!!!</p><p>Purple!!!</p><p>I am purple stardust, I am actually purple stardust!!!</p><p>...</p><p>"Oh my God, someone in the neighboring class awakened lightning!"</p><p>On the playground, a student suddenly shouted in shock.</p><p>"What what? Lightning appeared?? Wow, what great luck."</p><p>"Where is it, where is it, wow, so cool, that amazing purple color. The homeroom teacher of Class 7 must be terrified."</p><p>"Wuwuwu, kill me, why am I water element, why didn't they give me lightning, don't stop me, I want to go to the rooftop."</p><p>"Don't joke, you won't die by jumping, the ground is covered with light element corpses."</p><p>"This lightning student is going to dominate the whole scene!"</p><p>The appearance of lightning caused a commotion throughout the field!</p><p>If fire was the first awakening choice for all civilian mages, then lightning was undoubtedly the perfect first element bestowed by heaven. The overwhelming power of lightning gave mages an astonishing combat ability even at beginner level. Teachers have statistics showing that unless students themselves neglect their studies, over half of those who awakened lightning advanced to intermediate mages!</p><p>The mid-term magic exam directly eliminated about 60% of magic students, leaving the remaining 40% as awoken students.</p><p>Among these awoken students, perhaps 60% would be eliminated again because they couldn't cast any spells during their three-year high school life in magic.</p><p>Among the 1,500 new students in the entire school, only one student awakened to the Thunder affinity. This alone was enough to demonstrate how shocking and extraordinary the Thunder affinity truly was!!</p><p>...</p><p>In an instant, all the teachers and students turned their gaze towards that boy in Class 7 of Grade 1. Coincidentally, he was also wearing purple clothes, which made the faint purplish thunder arcs emanating from him even more striking and eye-catching. The confident and aloof-looking young man became the focal point of thousands of eyes, causing a commotion throughout the school!!</p><p>"Hey, what's all the noise?" Mo Fan slowly opened his eyes, his joy written all over his face.</p><p>However, when he opened his eyes, he found that his teacher, who had been staring at him, was now looking intently at the neighboring class, almost entranced by it.</p><p>Mo Fan turned around and saw that all his classmates were also looking at the neighboring class.</p><p>What's going on??</p><p>Where are you all looking??</p><p>Soon enough, Mo Fan finally figured out what was happening.</p><p>It turned out that a Thunder affinity student had appeared in the neighboring class. At the very moment he awakened, all the teachers and students turned their gazes towards that boy who had awakened a step ahead of them!</p><p>Mo Fan looked at the purplish thunder arcs still jumping on the awakening stone with a bitter face. He wished he could slap his homeroom teacher and tell him not to be jealous of the neighboring class student, as Mo Fan himself was an equally awesome and cool Thunder affinity user!!</p><p>Just as Mo Fan was about to speak, the awakening stone, which should have ended its process, once again emitted starlight, gathering towards Mo Fan's palm like blood vessels.</p><p>Mo Fan was full of amazement!</p><p>Hadn't the awakening process ended? Why did the awakening stone activate again?</p><p>Mo Fan tried to pull his hand away, but that magical force had already spread throughout his entire body through his palm.</p><p>Heated.</p><p>A burst of fiery energy!</p><p>Mo Fan had no idea what was happening, but a force compelled him to enter the spiritual world once again, sensing the intrusion of this second wave of power.</p><p>In the void of the spiritual realm, purple stardust still shimmered faintly in its own region, seemingly eager for someone to make it shine brighter and burst forth.</p><p>This was Mo Fan's Thunder series stardust, a recently awakened power.</p><p>But another awakened force, similar to the lightning series before, intruded into Mo Fan's spiritual world, leaving a striking arc of flame across his mental landscape. It looked like a burning meteor, causing Mo Fan's entire body to tremble!</p><p>"This... This..."</p><p>A patch of "red stardust" appeared in his own spiritual realm!!!!</p><p>Mo Fan was initially bewildered but then fell into an almost manic state of joy!!!</p><p>Fire series!!!</p><p>He had awakened another Fire series!!!</p><p>It was dual-series!!</p><p>He had actually awakened dual-series!!!</p><p>One must understand that among beginners at the Mage level, all students could only awaken one series. The probability of being born with a natural dual-series power was virtually non-existent, much less than one in a thousand for the Thunder series!!!</p><p>Oh my God!!!</p><p>Mo Fan felt as if he had been knocked out by happiness.</p><p>The appearance of the Lightning series had already made him ecstatic, and now the Flame series appeared again, forming his natural dual-series. He was on the verge of tears from sheer joy!!</p><p>Mofan, who had delved into magical knowledge for over two decades, was very clear that having an extra discipline meant starting ahead of others. The cultivation of each discipline was independent of the others.</p><p>It was like a MMORPG where everyone on the server could only create one character and toil away grinding monsters, leveling up, and cultivating, while he could directly open two characters. More importantly, these two characters could be fused into one, making his combat power not simply 1+1=2!</p><p>This was amazing!!</p><p>I was born with dual disciplines, an explosive Lightning Discipline and a brutal Fire Discipline. Let’s see who can stop me!</p><p>The shame and guilt of his father selling the house at that moment vanished completely. Mofan was very clear that if he cultivated diligently and worked hard, mastering both disciplines would make him superior to other mages of his level.</p><p>What about the Mu Clan with their hundreds of years of accumulation or the Ice Family? Could they boast a natural dual discipline like me!!</p><p>Hahaha, hahaha, hahaha!!!</p>
