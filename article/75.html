						<p>"There's no need, there's no need. You're going to university now; who will live in the house? Xinxia is better off staying with her aunt. We big men can't take good care of her. I give your aunt money every month... Speaking of which, there are over ten thousand dollars in the card you gave me. Plus the eighty thousand dollars I've made from driving cars these years, it totals up to around twenty thousand dollars. That should be enough for a magic tool. I heard that this thing is very important for mages."</p><p>Mojia Xing continued.</p><p>"Magic tool? I already have one!"</p><p>"Oh, oh, I completely forgot. You got a magic tool from Zhankaung. Speaking of which, you really made me proud! I heard the old hunters talking about it countless times at the inn!" When mentioning this matter, Mojia Xing's face lit up with pride. Little did he know that it had already been a year.</p><p>"Tomorrow, I will go to Mushi Mountain Estate for a magic duel with someone named Yuaang," Mo Fan said seriously to Mojia Xing.</p><p>"I know, I know. I asked some of the old folks in Mushi to persuade Yuaang to ease up on you. After all, you're just there to add some color to his coming-of-age ceremony. Being able to showcase yourself in front of so many important figures in Boling City is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you. Speaking of which, how did you come up with this brilliant idea back then... However, don't offend Old Master Mu again. He was still upset about what happened between you and Ning Xue. You really pulled off something big there; you almost took away their family's gem! At such a young age!"</p><p>Mojia Xing said.</p><p>Regarding that matter in the past, Mojia Xing didn't blame Mo Fan.</p><p>At that time, Mo Fan was still very young, and it was normal for him to do silly things. Besides, the problem wasn't entirely his son's fault; the issue lay with how powerful the other family's influence truly was.</p><p>Sigh, if Mu Ningxue had been a girl from an ordinary family, Mojia Xing would have another daughter-in-law. This brat of a son has no other talent except for his ability to kidnap girls at such a young age!</p><p>This magic duel seemed like a huge opportunity for Mojia Xing.</p><p>Like many better-off descendants, they all wanted to appear in this grand coming-of-age ceremony. Even if it was just to accompany Yuaang as support, it was still an unparalleled honor. It was indeed a great chance for Mo Fan, the silent youth. But don't let your arrogance get out of control and think you can win against others; we have no idea about their family background. Being able to serve as a supporting role is good enough in the future. If Yuaang truly becomes an important figure in Boling City, at least you'll have the title of having "fought alongside him"!</p><p>"Dad, I can win!" Mo Fan said sincerely.</p><p>"Don't be too arrogant; don't be too arrogant. I'm already very satisfied with your current achievements," Mojia Xing laughed heartily as he patted Mo Fan's shoulder.</p><p>Seeing his father's attitude, Mo Fan was puzzled.</p><p>Why do you all think I'm going there to be cannon fodder??</p><p>...</p><p>The Mushi Family sent out their invitations early on. The entire Mushi Estate was filled with distinguished guests and celebrities, which made the workers living around the estate very busy. Even a single weed in a flowerbed would require great effort to deal with.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun really put a lot of effort into this coming-of-age ceremony, making the entire Bo City talk about it.</p><p>Previously, Mo Fan had been puzzled as to why Mu Zhuoyun had forced him and You Ang to duel. It turned out that the old fox had planned it all along, adding an exciting element to their grand feast.</p><p>Simply eating and drinking wouldn't have been any fun. Watching young people fight was much more entertaining, not only ridding them of Mo Fan this gutter rat in front of everyone but also boosting Mu Family's reputation. What was there to lose?</p><p>To be honest, Mo Fan really hadn't expected the old rogue Mu Zhuoyun to make such a big fuss.</p><p>As Principal Zhu and Deng Kai had said, it was indeed a competition between members of prestigious families and school students in Bo City.</p><p>Mo Fan now truly deserved his title as the top student at Tianlan Magic High School. Even if he didn't get into trouble with Old Master Mu, he would likely end up fighting those from prestigious families sooner or later.</p><p>Well, let's settle old and new scores together!</p><p>"Old rogue, the bigger you make this fuss, the uglier I'll make your face!!!" Mo Fan stood in front of the old house, looking up at the brightly lit and elaborately decorated Mu Family Manor with a sneer on his face.</p><p>...</p><p>On top of the manor, Mu Zuoyun sneezed for no apparent reason.</p><p>He was sitting in the tea room, touching his facial hair as he looked proudly at his daughter Mu Ningxue, who had already returned home from summer break.</p><p>"Originally, this coming-of-age ceremony was meant for you, but Dad didn't expect you to be much better than we imagined. The small Bo City is no longer something you should be vying for. This coming-of-age ceremony is for You Ang. He's completely devoted to our family and can become your left arm and right hand in future battles with other prestigious family offspring!" Mu Zhuoyun said.</p><p>He had indeed put a lot of thought into this daughter, Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>"Why do you insist on going after him? If you need a legitimate reason for You Ang to get the opportunity at the Sacred Spring, you could choose someone else." Finally, Mu Ningxue couldn't hold back and spoke up.</p><p>She was referring to Mo Fan, of course.</p><p>"That little rogue cursed me in front of everyone. Could I just let it go? He thinks he's so superior and believes himself to be invincible. Giving him such a great opportunity wasn't improper. I've already arranged everything; you just sit by and watch." Mu Zhuoyun's expression changed at the mention of this matter.</p><p>Are you still protecting that brat?</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun couldn't understand why, with so many outstanding offspring from prominent families, she wouldn't even bother to speak to any of them. Why did she care about a penniless boy who only talks tough but has no real abilities?</p><p>"That's called Yua Ang, stop it!" Mu Ningxue knew her father would never compromise on this matter, so she laid out her own bottom line.</p><p>"Don't worry, I know my limits. I just want that presumptuous brat to understand that the little dignity he had was nothing when I stepped on it. And tomorrow, he'll realize that losing face in front of everyone is what true humiliation means!" Mu Zhuoyun couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>Little one, you played with me, Mu Zhuoyun, during my glory days in Boxue City; at the time, you were still in your mother's womb.</p><p>I, Mu Zhuoyun, can think of ways to make you unable to raise your head again in Boxue City!</p>
