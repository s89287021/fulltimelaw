						<p>"Is it C??"</p><p>"No, no, the light is still spreading slowly."</p><p>Several examiners looked just as puzzled. While other students had quickly completed the test, this student's light started off weak but gradually grew stronger, from D to C, and continued to shine even after reaching C.</p><p>"There's a B! There definitely is a B!!"</p><p>"What the hell? I only got a C, how could this guy get a B?" Even Huang Feifeng, another Fire user, was nearly in tears.</p><p>Zhou Min got an A++, and that weakling named Da Niu got a B. Out of the four Fire users, it was only Huang Feifeng who got a C. How would he be able to compete for Teacher Tang Yue's favor now!</p><p>Xue Mushi's eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>As the class teacher, what he feared most was having a student hold back the whole class. Today, Xue Mushi only wished that Mo Fan didn't take that unused spot from three years ago; this Buddha figure could drag him down as much as he wanted.</p><p>What Xue Mushi couldn't have imagined was that this kid would suddenly come up with a B!!</p><p>The average score should be around B-.</p><p>This Buddha actually exceeded the average score. He never dreamed of it happening.</p><p>Now, Xue Mushi was even happier to see this B than he would be to see an A student!</p><p>The discussion this time wasn't any smaller than when Mu Bai spoke just now. After all, everyone considered Mu Bai to have a good score, while Mo Fan was universally regarded as the worst of the dunces.</p><p>A dunce suddenly getting a B? Too many people were caught off guard!</p><p>"How is this possible... How is this possible..." This time, Mu Bai was dumbfounded!</p><p>His uncle Mu He was also completely baffled.</p><p>What's going on? How did this kid get a B???</p><p>"Mu Bai, have you put the dark stone down yet? That dark stone absorbs a lot of light; even a C-level person can turn into someone who can't even get a D," Mu He whispered to Mu Bai.</p><p>"I have, I absolutely have," Mu Bai said. Even if he failed the exam himself, he couldn't afford to fail at this step.</p><p>The dark stone must be in place, so why did this guy get a B??</p><p>Isn't he hovering between C and D? Could it be that he hid his strength and suddenly pulled off a B-level grade on the exam?</p><p>A C is passable, but a B is excellent!</p><p>Can you imagine a student who was supposed to be punished for three years turning into an excellent student all of a sudden?</p><p>"Hmm, as expected, just ordinary," Mu Zhuoyun said with a flat tone that hinted at self-mockery.</p><p>His daughter almost got snatched away by this kid??</p><p>If something like that happened, he would be laughed at by the whole world!</p><p>"Alright, let's go to the next class," Mu Zhuoyun said, not wanting his daughter to focus too much on this kid.</p><p>"Big brother, what about Mu Bai..." Mu He said with a lingering tone.</p><p>Mu He wasn't satisfied with the result. On one hand, he wanted Mu Bai to stand out in the family and gain attention from the patriarch; on the other hand, he wanted Mo Fan to be completely eliminated. Neither of these goals was achieved, so how could they just leave?</p><p>"Oh, give their family a bit more during New Year as an encouragement," Mu Zhuoyun replied.</p><p>Hearing this, Mu Bai froze in shock.</p><p>What is "get more during the New Year"? </p><p>"This... elder brother, I think..." Mu He was just about to say more for Mu Bai when another voice cut in.</p><p>"That's not right, that light is not correct!"</p><p>Suddenly, someone raised a doubt. It was a woman's voice, soft and sexy, mature and alluring.</p><p>"Ms Tang Yue, do you have any doubts about this judgment? In principle, the exam results are determined by the invigilators. Even if we have our doubts..."</p><p>Xue M Sheng began to speak. </p><p>In fact, Xue M Sheng was already entirely satisfied with this score; he even suspected that there might be an issue with the Star Sensation Stone, because how could Mo Fan get a B?</p><p>Ms Tang Yue, please do not let this slide! If there really is a problem, I as your class teacher will not be able to maintain my reputation!</p><p>"The teacher has no right to question the judgment, but they can question any anomalies that occurred during the examination... even check the testing equipment to ensure its accuracy." Ms Tang Yue stated with righteous indignation.</p><p>At this moment, several school leaders were secretly shaking their heads at Ms Tang Yue.</p><p>The principal was also continuously signaling to her.</p><p>It wasn't because the school leaders knew about any hidden tricks; it was simply that they did not want unnecessary complications in front of so many board members.</p><p>What's wrong with this result? It's perfectly normal, after all, it's just an average student's score.</p><p>"Why do you doubt the results, teacher?" Mu Zhuo Yun showed some interest and asked.</p><p>Ms Tang Yue had already entered the examination room. Her eyebrows were furrowed.</p><p>Suddenly, she closed her eyes as if she was a magician about to cast a spell.</p><p>People who understand magic should know that she was actually sensing.</p><p>...</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue's actions immediately panicked Mu He and Mu Bai.</p><p>In theory, once Mo Fan had completed the test, the assessment would have stopped, allowing the students to rest while also announcing the list of outstanding students from the first half of the examination.</p><p>Taking advantage of this break time, that bald examiner could quietly take away the dark stone without arousing suspicion, proceeding with the entire exam seamlessly.</p><p>Everything seemed to be going smoothly until a teacher suddenly stepped forward and appeared to have discovered something amiss.</p><p>Of course, Mu He had to shout; he wanted to use his authority to intimidate the teacher who had found the problem.</p><p>However, Teacher Tang Yue was not afraid at all. She seemed to have discovered something and directly walked over to the Star Sensing Stone.</p><p>"There is a problem with the Star Sensing Stone; this examination must be redone," Teacher Tang Yue said, staring intently at the examiner.</p><p>The bald examiner's expression immediately became uncertain as he hastily turned to look at Mu He.</p><p>Mu He could no longer maintain his composure on his face.</p><p>Mu Bai's expression was even more panicked.</p><p>"What are you standing there for? Go check it out. We must provide candidates with a fair and just examination environment. Any issues should be addressed immediately," Principal Tian Lan said with great righteousness.</p><p>The three examiners went forward to inspect the stone and quickly discovered the hidden dark stone.</p><p>"That's strange, we've already checked everything before; how did this thing get in here?" another examiner said in surprise.</p><p>After each candidate's exam was completed, a recheck would be conducted. For Mu Bai, the examiner who conducted the recheck was the bald-headed proctor.</p><p>This really pissed off the bald-headed proctor!</p><p>Cheating and framing candidates during exams were serious offenses.</p>
