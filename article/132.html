						<p>The small reservoir had to be at least a hundred meters in diameter. On this parched and sunken land, the surface resembled countless beasts colliding, with streams of fire erupting wildly into the air from below!</p><p>One stream of fire, crimson like a massive flaming whale leaping out of the sea, creating an impressive wave!</p><p>Following it, eight more magnificent streams of fire broke free from the shattered ground, surging upwards.</p><p>The waves of flames rolled in all directions and collided, forming even fiercer infernos that devastated everything in their path.</p><p>Tongues of fire danced wildly between the nine columns of fiery flames, resembling ferocious beasts baring their claws, furious beyond control!</p><p>A Blaze Fist surged up nine palace flames!!</p><p>Each spout of flame reflected off one another, transforming into a grand feast of flames, wreaking havoc and burning everything within that hundred-meter radius.</p><p>Previously, the power of the four fire-elemental men from the Dongfang Family's mid-level magic was already formidable. But compared to this Flame Annihilation Queen, they were nothing more than mere scraps. The same skill felt like it belonged in entirely different realms!</p><p>Mo Fan had never witnessed Teacher Tang Yue's true strength before, and his heart suddenly couldn't handle the shock!</p><p>That Chao He would have to be reduced to ashes back and forth.</p><p>...</p><p>The immense energy of the Blaze Fist shook the entire mountain range. Not long ago, this was a dry reservoir. After "Phoenix Flame · Blaze Fist · Nine Palaces," it was beyond description what remained.</p><p>When the overwhelming power of the flames finally began to subside, Mo Fan looked in Chao He's direction to see if the guy was dead...</p><p>However, Mo Fan was shocked once more.</p><p>Chao He was still there, enveloped by a thick layer of rock armor.</p><p>The rock armor had been burned beyond recognition and was beginning to fall apart piece by piece.</p><p>After the rock armor peeled off, Chao He's clearly burned body was exposed. His skin, scorched black in some places, coughed violently several times. Those eyes of his suddenly burst with murderous fury!</p><p>"You've destroyed my precious Rock Army Devil Armor! It looks like you'll need to use your ample body to vent my anger for a few years before I can be placated and allow you to die peacefully!" Chao He's entire body shook as he threw the completely ruined armor away.</p><p>Injured, Chao He no longer had that sickly elegance; he was now nothing but a beast—cruel and savage.</p><p>His eyes were fixed intently on Tang Yue, who was already gasping for breath. It seemed as if his gaze alone could tear Tang Yue's body to pieces.</p><p>"Damn it!!!" Seeing that Chao He was not severely injured, Tang Yue's expression became even more serious.</p><p>In fact, in a one-on-one fight, Tang Yue, with her Sparrow Flame, still had the upper hand over Chao He. Otherwise, there would have been no way for them to send her alone to track down Chao He.</p><p>However, this fellow Chao He was too cunning. The drugs he had given her might not be fatal, but they severely impaired her control of her star essence. The intense desire to unleash it was almost driving her mad.</p><p>How many doses of that chronic poison had she taken for things to be like this?</p><p>If it were just the effect of those drugs alone, Tang Yue would still have some strength to fight back. However, at this moment, she could feel a faint coldness emanating from all around her—it was an intermediate-level curse magic. This damn Chao He had even included her in his plan!!</p><p>Tang Yue now had to prepare for the worst—that if she fell into this villain's hands, she would have to destroy her body to avoid endless humiliation.</p><p>Still, she held onto some hope.</p><p>This flicker of hope was Mo Fan, whom she had summoned just in case something went wrong. Tang Yue had called Mo Fan out of concern that something unexpected might happen, plus the fact that Chao He was also a Fire Mage made him quite difficult for her to deal with.</p><p>The binding of the invisible black spider silk and the effects of the drugs made her want to tear off all her clothes in that scorching heat.</p><p>"Blazing Fist · Heaven-Shattering!"</p><p>All the trees were reduced to powder under this sudden sweeping punch, with raging flames surging fiercely!</p><p>The giant flaming fist was targeting Zhao He. Zhao He's face was filled with shock; he never thought that there was still an intermediate-level mage hiding in the forest after feeling like he was on the verge of victory!</p><p>"BOOM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>The blazing fist exploded at the location where Zhao He stood, creating another huge crater.</p><p>Mo Fan stood far away, watching the chaotic flames and felt that Zhao He should have been reduced to rubble.</p><p>However, Mo Fan, who was cautious and prudent, did not easily step out of the forest. What if there were still more traps, causing him and Teacher Tang Yue to fall into them together?</p><p>"He's not dead!" When Mo Fan saw Zhao He still standing there, his expression turned serious.</p><p>Even a sneak attack failed. Just how many cards does this guy have up his sleeve!</p><p>Mo Fan could only describe his mood at the moment with four words: f*cked!</p><p>On the other side, a semicircular shield made entirely of blue water appeared around Zhao He.</p><p>Behind the water shield, Zhao He's face had twisted in agony.</p><p>Despite timely activating the Water Shield for protection, he was still shaken by the impact force of the blazing fist, causing intense pain throughout his organs, making him feel extremely uncomfortable!</p><p>"Brat, you want to save a beauty, but do you know your own strength!" With blood overflowing from his mouth, Zhao He stared at Mo Fan with fierce eyes, looking as if he wanted to devour him. "We're both fire mages; how much damage can you deal to me? You're just an intermediate-level mage who hasn't awakened a second element and think you can fight me?"</p><p>Higher-ranked mages could easily determine the strength of other mages through perception and intent. At first, Zhao He thought another judge had appeared, but upon careful sensing, he realized it was merely an intermediate-level guy, not as strong as those four people from the Eastern clans before.</p><p>Lian Second System had not awakened, so Chao He was relieved! Seeing that this boy clearly accompanied Tang Yue, there was still room for negotiation. One might even emerge victorious!</p><p>——————————————</p><p>(%!(EXTRA string=Please don't ask for monthly ticket votes, please vote for recommendation tickets~~~~~~~~~~~~!
