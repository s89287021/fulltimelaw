						<p>Tang Yue still maintained a very upright posture as she stood there, her graceful figure outlined elegantly beneath the slightly narrow dress. Perhaps it was due to the haste in choosing her attire at the beginning of her teaching career that this was the case, but it certainly provided a feast for the students' eyes.</p><p>"Stay calm, remain peaceful, and focus on your task. Even as I speak to you now, my mind is entirely devoted to my Fire Nebula... oh, Fire Dust," Teacher Tang Yue said.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue's voice reached every student's ears. When everyone felt that she was standing there like a statue, suddenly her pear-shaped hair began to move.</p><p>There was not a breeze in the entire playground, yet it seemed as if her hair was spreading out in a wave of heat!</p><p>"Control, at this moment you are the summoner. Command your stars to follow your instructions and open the gate to Fire Magic Energy!!" Teacher Tang Yue's voice suddenly changed from soft to solemn, even carrying an air of superiority that everything would be reduced to ashes before her!</p><p>In that instant, all the male students whose minds were filled with impure thoughts froze.</p><p>They widened their eyes in shock as they looked at this beautiful teacher.</p><p>Breath!!</p><p>Yes, they felt a scorching aura emanating from Teacher Tang Yue, hitting them on their faces.</p><p>There was surprise, reverence, and an awe that prevented any disrespect!</p><p>Everyone had thought that the newly arrived Teacher Tang Yue was just an ordinary teacher who could only impart some chaotic theories like Old Li. They expected her to make mistakes when casting spells herself, but this young Teacher Tang Yue seemed to have mastered this power for a long time. She could teach and control the stars simultaneously, and after completing the spell formation, the fire breath she emitted was not at all comparable to Old Li's—it was as if it were a spark versus a pillar of flame!</p><p>"Remember, after arranging your stars, do not relax your mind in any way; you must immediately lock onto your release position!!"</p><p>That authoritative voice rang out again.</p><p>"Fire Surge? Burn!"</p><p>The sound resonated like a magic bell, echoing in everyone's minds.</p><p>At the same time, a striking red star trail appeared around Teacher Tang Yue. After flashing past her surroundings, it rapidly condensed on her fair and smooth right hand.</p><p>Mo Fan did not know how others felt, but he could feel his heart pounding. It was not just because of this teacher's alluring beauty; it was also due to the confidence and noble aura she exuded when wielding flame power, causing his blood vessels to swell with admiration, infatuation, and reverence!</p><p>If a woman is merely beautiful, she brings eternal fantasies to others. However, this woman holds power and strength that others cannot touch, making her like a drug that men cannot resist!</p><p>Heaven knows how many boys would consider Teacher Tang Yue their lifelong idol from this scene. At least Mo Fan was conquered by her demeanor.</p><p>The same as a magic practice class teacher, Old Man Lian's spells were lifeless, making one feel drowsy to watch.</p><p>Tang Yue's spells left an indelible impression on the hearts of the students, causing inner shock that could not be calmed for a long time.</p><p>It was simply not in the same league!!</p><p>"Alright, which students in our class are fire mages? Let me take note." Tang Yue seemed to find it ordinary to receive such adoring gazes from the students and continued her lesson.</p><p>"I am a fire mage," a girl with a touch of spirit on her face stood up first. She was Zhou Min, who had caused a small stir at the opening ceremony.</p><p>Zhou Min's eyes were fixed on Teacher Tang Yue.</p><p>At first, Zhou Min really did not like her; who would enjoy a teacher dressed so provocatively and speaking in such a soft voice!</p><p>But after seeing Teacher Tang Yue complete that spell, Zhou Min underwent a 180-degree transformation, filled with admiration.</p><p>Zhou Min's mother was also a teacher, but she could be certain that her mother could not match what Teacher Tang Yue did, whether it was presence, proficiency, accuracy, or power!</p><p>"I am one too. Tang Yue Teacher, I am a fire mage!! My name is Huang Feifeng." Another boy who awakened his fire powers jumped out.</p><p>Look at Huang Feifeng's excited expression?</p><p>Who would not know that if the magic practice class teacher shared your element, you would receive special treatment, like being a disciple in person.</p><p>Huang Feifeng felt incredibly fortunate to have become Teacher Tang Yue's personal disciple. Who could say that Teacher Tang Yue would not develop feelings for his talent in the future? She would be his Little Dragon Girl!</p><p>"Don't stop me, I want to go to the rooftop. Why didn't I awaken as a Fire-type? Why not!!" Lu Xiaobin, who had awakened as a Water-type, was crying there.</p><p>"Tea… Teacher, I'm also a Fire… Fire-type. My name is Zhao Dainiu." A stuttering little boy stepped forward, his whole face turning red when he met Teacher Tang Yue's eyes.</p><p>Sigh, it was clear that this was a usually unnoticeable nobody.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue looked at the little boy and burst into laughter: "You are clearly very thin, why did your family name you Dainiu?"</p><p>"I… I'm weak. My parents… parents hope… hope I would be as strong as a bull."</p><p>"Then you should have been named Zhao Kuaizui," Zhao Kunsan, the mouthy guy, immediately mocked.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan was naturally mocking Zhao Dainiu's stuttering.</p><p>"Hmm, anyone else?" Teacher Tang Yue scanned the class.</p><p>Only three Fire-types in the whole class?</p><p>That seemed a bit too few.</p><p>From their aura, it seemed that only Zhou Min, the girl, had better talent and better cultivation progress.</p><p>"I can too, I'm Mo Fan." Mo Fan snapped back to his senses and walked out of the crowd.</p><p>"Don't stop me; I need to go to the rooftop. Why wasn’t I awakened as a Fire-type? Why not!!" Lu Xiaobin, who had awakened as a Water-type, was crying there.</p><p>"T-Teacher, I’m also a Fire-t-Fire type… My name is Zhao Dainiu." A stuttering little boy stepped forward; his face turned bright red when he met Teacher Tang Yue's eyes.</p><p>Sigh. It was clear that this boy wasn't usually the center of attention.</p><p>Teacher Tang Yue looked at the little boy and burst into laughter: "You are clearly very thin, why did your family name you Dainiu?"</p><p>"I… I'm weak. M-My parents hope… hope I would be as strong as a bull."</p><p>"Then you should have been named Zhao Kuaizui," Zhao Kunsan, the mouthy guy, immediately mocked.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan was naturally mocking Zhao Dainiu's stuttering.</p><p>"Hmm, anyone else?" Teacher Tang Yue scanned the class.</p><p>Only three Fire-types in the whole class?</p><p>That seemed a bit too few.</p><p>From their aura, it seemed that only Zhou Min, the girl, had better talent and better cultivation progress.</p><p>"I can too; I'm Mo Fan." Mo Fan snapped back to his senses and walked out of the crowd.</p><p>"Don't hold me back; I need to go to the rooftop. Why didn’t I awaken as a Fire-type? Why not!!" Lu Xiaobin, who had awakened as a Water-type, was crying there.</p><p>"T-Teacher, I’m also a Fire-t-Fire type… My name is Zhao Dainiu." A stuttering little boy stepped forward; his face turned bright red when he met Teacher Tang Yue's eyes.</p><p>Sigh.

Mo Fan snapped back to his senses and walked out of the crowd.</p>
