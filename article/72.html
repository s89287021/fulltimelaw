						<p>Mò Fán's meditation time was always longer than others, and with the assistance of the stardust magic artifact, he could easily meditate for 12 hours a day.</p><p>However, human time is ultimately limited. If more advanced stardust magic artifacts only allowed him to extend his meditation time, the significance would not be very great. Mò Fán could not possibly use all 24 hours of the day for meditation?</p><p>After practical battles, Mò Fán realized that relying solely on meditation to enhance one's strength as a mage was far from sufficient. Instead, experiencing battles, facing threats to his life, and encountering powerful enemies could spur a gradual increase in the stardust to some extent.</p><p>Therefore, while maintaining daily long hours of practice, Mò Fán also had to join the demon hunting teams.</p><p>To Mò Fán's surprise, a Spirit Rank stardust magic artifact not only allowed him to meditate continuously but also nourished the stardust to some extent directly.</p><p>Even without meditation, the stardust would grow slowly.</p><p>During meditation, the stardust grew at an even higher efficiency!</p><p>Since Mò Fán's meditation time was already maximized and his meditation efficiency further improved, it was truly like rocketing in terms of enhancement!</p><p>"Great, this way, I can not only upgrade my fire magic skills to level three before graduation but also increase my lightning magic to the third tier. With more effort, there's a chance I could reach the threshold of a mid-rank mage!!"</p><p>When the starlets reached the third tier, it meant that the stardust was close to evolving into a star cloud!</p><p>Mò Fán had already looked up quite a bit of information on mid-rank mages.</p><p>Initially, the system formed in a mage's spiritual world was called stardust.</p><p>And when this stardust in the mage's spiritual world transformed into a more splendid and dazzling region known as a star cloud, it meant that the mage had reached the mid-rank level!</p><p>A star cloud was larger than stardust. If stardust were just faint specks of dust in the vast universe, then a star cloud was like a cluster of stars gathered together, with abundant magic energy and more starlets wandering within. When a mage could form a specific star pattern from those numerous starlets in an entire star cloud, it meant that a powerful mid-rank spell would shatter the sky and descend powerfully!</p><p>Starlets connecting to form constellations within stardust were basic spells!</p><p>Stars within the nebula connect to form star charts, which are intermediate-level magic! Mo Fan would never forget that Intermediate Mage Yang Zuohé stood on an incredibly mysterious and magnificent chart of stars when he released his intermediate magic. Unlike the fleeting glow of star trails, star charts were more beautiful and enigmatic, holding power that could make all mages still at the beginner level yearn for it!</p><p>The intermediate water-based magic, Wave Surge, which could fill an entire street, and the intermediate wind-based magic, Wind Coil, which could lift a one-car weight monocular wolf to tens of meters in the air—besides being awesome, their power was off the charts, far beyond that of basic skills!</p><p>It's not just that wind-based and water-based intermediate magic were so impressive; once I master intermediate lightning-based and fire-based skills, there'll be no need to fear the Mu Family anymore?!</p><p>Diligent practice, diligent practice!</p><p>My great Mo Fan's splendid life has only just begun!!</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>Winter winds in the north had always been invincible. Wherever they went, trees would shed all their leaves, baring themselves.</p><p>In the south, trees ignored winter winds; no matter how strong the wind blew, they remained lush and green year-round. Shedding a few leaves was out of respect for the season, while keeping a green crown all 365 days was routine.</p><p>Mo Fan lived in Bocheng, a city where seasons weren't particularly distinct, with transitions happening within a single day. That meant Typhoon Dad was on his way.</p><p>Everyone knew that merely graduating from high school as a mage often meant struggling to find better positions in society and even harder to advance to higher-level magic. To truly stand out and become respected mages, they had to pass magical college examinations; only then would their chances of becoming intermediate mages increase.</p><p>Intermediate mages were a complete transformation for all mages, and every student was striving toward this goal with wild enthusiasm.</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan, I've awakened the healing magic. In the future, if Big Brother Mo Fan gets injured, I can use magic to heal you," a text message appeared silently, accompanied by an adorable smiley face emoji.</p><p>Mo Fan was slightly taken aback.</p><p>"Ni ma, what's going on?"</p><p>"Healing type?? Why would you awaken as a healing type? We all awakened as elemental types. Why did you awaken White Magic at the initial stage?" Mo Fan messaged anxiously.</p><p>"Most people's first awakened type is elemental, but there are always exceptions. Also, I heard that if you use a certain special item to guide your awakening, there's a certain probability of awakening a specific magic type," Ye Xinxia replied.</p><p>"Guided awakening??? So if I want to awaken the Dark type when I reach the intermediate stage, can I also complete it through the guidance you mentioned?" Mo Fan felt elated, as if he had found a whole new world.</p><p>"Yes, provided that you can gather the guiding substance."</p><p>"Xinxia, I love you so much. You've solved a major problem for me."</p><p>Mo Fan's mood lifted instantly.</p><p>He had always believed that awakenings were random, whatever type you got was what you got, and he hadn't thought about guided awakenings existing in this world. So when he reached the intermediate stage and got another awakening opportunity, if he tried guided awakening, he could get the Dark type!!</p><p>Both Lightning Dust and Fire Dust were progressing smoothly, improving at a speed even faster than he had imagined. Especially after Meditation Training and battles with the Monster Hunting Teams, he had already far outdistanced his classmates.</p><p>However, there was no need to be so ostentatious about it. When the day of the Magic College Entrance Exam arrived, his friends would surely drop their jaws in surprise!</p>
