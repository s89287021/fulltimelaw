						<p>The charm of the moonlight, Pingcheng, with its tranquility, exudes the softness and elegance typical of southern cities. The water surrounds the city, flowing gently; the mountains lie outside the city, stretching endlessly.</p><p>Tomorrow is an incredibly important day for my life.</p><p>Children from poor families don't have coming-of-age rituals, but to others, I already had a pretty good one: being a sidekick at the coming-of-age ceremony of a wealthy family's son.</p><p>In their eyes, I was undoubtedly the one squatting on the ground to raise Yuang's dark leather shoes, making him stand out among his peers.</p><p>But is that really true?</p><p>Lifting the beer nearby, Mo Fan raised his head and swallowed the icy drink in one gulp.</p><p>Before him stood a cluster of skyscrapers, with the World Trade Center building towering nearly 100 meters tall right before him. It looked like a solitary sword proudly standing at the heart of the dazzling city.</p><p>Mo Fan sat on the balcony as strong winds swept towards him. He had always enjoyed sitting here in the past, where he could see the bustling scenes of Pingcheng, the World Trade Center building, Mu Family Mansion, the Bo River cutting through the city, and Tianlan Magic High School nestled in Nanshan.</p><p>When he felt a sense of nostalgia, footsteps were heard from behind the corridor. They were rhythmic and gentle.</p><p>A cool breeze blew past his back, and Mo Fan didn't need to turn around to know who it was.</p><p>"I asked Xinxia, she said you were here." The girl's clear and pleasant voice came over. If not for her aloofness, this voice would have been as sweet as a silver bell in the snow.</p><p>"So late at night looking for me? I can't run with you this time," Mo Fan casually grabbed a newspaper used to wrap peanuts and tossed it beside him, gesturing for the person to sit next to him.</p><p>Mu Ningxue stood there. Seeing Mo Fan's familiar action, her eyes held a flicker of something.</p><p>When they were young, he would take her to some strange places to play. He could sit on the ground anywhere, but she was afraid of dirtying her pretty dress and wouldn't dare to do so. She didn't know when he started to find any slightly clean thing to put beside him whenever he sat down, including his shirt. Even though his shirts were sometimes dirty.</p><p>"Don't go tomorrow; Yuang will be ruthless with you. He follows my father's orders blindly, no matter how slight a disadvantage towards my father, even just one insult, he would take it as an injustice and pursue it relentlessly." Mu Ningxue didn't walk over but stood there telling Mo Fan this.</p><p>"Your dad really adopted a good dog; I bet in all of Pingcheng, whoever he bites is toast," Mo Fan had no liking for Yuang at all.</p><p>"He is very peculiar, and I don't like him either," Mu Ningxue said.</p><p>"Well, I'll teach him a lesson tomorrow," Mo Fan said with a smile.</p><p>"Don't you understand? I told you not to go tomorrow."</p><p>"Miss, have you reached the intermediate level of mage yet?"</p><p>"Don't go tomorrow. If you survive this ordeal, head straight to the Mage University. Over the four years at university, I will gradually gain control over the family's power. By then, when you return to Bo City, no one will dare touch you."</p><p>"Are you going to support me financially? But I still have to go."</p><p>Mo Fan turned around and said with pretended surprise, "You…"</p><p>Mu Ningxue was so angry that her chest heaved.</p><p>She was seriously trying to help him, but he was making jokes. Didn't he know that offending his father meant there would be no place for Mo Fan in Bo City!</p><p>Seeing that she couldn't communicate with Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue turned and left.</p><p>...</p><p>"Fan, I heard the little princess came looking for you," Zhang Xiahou messaged to ask.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"How was it?"</p><p>"She still adores me, making me realize how much I need to torment that guy named Yu Ang."</p><p>"Speak English, please."</p><p>"Alright, she told me to run so as not to get killed, hahaha."</p><p>"Fan Ge, I also suggest you run. Yu Ang is a psychopath; the whole person just feels strange."</p><p>...</p><p>This day finally arrived.</p><p>Early in the morning, Mo Fan, who was staying at his aunt Mo Qing's place, could already hear festive sounds coming from the nearby manor.</p><p>One luxurious sedan after another drove up the winding mountain road into the Mu Family Manor. People like Mo Fan, who took a motorcycle to get there, didn't know whether they were embarrassing themselves with the title "Yu Ang's Rival."</p><p>Just as he stepped in front of the large iron gate, Mo Fan saw several familiar figures.</p><p>"Li Wenjie, Fat Shi, you finally came. Come in quickly; we have some of the best chefs in Bocheng here, guaranteed to meet your tastes," Guo Caitang greeted her teammates at the door.</p><p>"How a pity that Fan Mo couldn't come due to something. Otherwise, he would have had a chance to see your luxurious life, Caitang. He would definitely chase after you relentlessly then," Li Wenjie remarked.</p><p>Guo Caitang shot Li Wenjie a fierce glare.</p><p>Guo Caitang actually felt somewhat disappointed; she really wanted to invite Fan Mo over for a visit this time.</p><p>Eh, is that Fan Mo??</p><p>Guo Caitang's gaze shifted, and she suddenly saw a familiar figure. Upon closer inspection, Guo Caitang was instantly filled with disgust and irritation.</p><p>It wasn't Fan Mo at all; it was clearly Mo Fan, that little punk.</p><p>I really don't know what kind of gall this brat has to duel Yu Ang. He must end up half-dead.</p><p>"Hmph, you're here?" Guo Caitang looked sideways at Mo Fan with sheer arrogance.</p><p>"Yes, there's nowhere to have breakfast." Mo Fan said with a lascivious tone.</p><p>Guo Cai Tang was seething. What did this punk think the Mu Family Estate was? A free buffet!</p><p>"If you apologize now, I'll make Yu Ang go easier on you," Guo Cai Tang coldly sneered.</p><p>"You're still hung up on me stripping my undershirt? Big deal, I'll take full responsibility for it. It's not a big deal," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Go to hell!"</p><p>After teasing Guo Cai Tang, Mo Fan laughed loudly and walked toward the Mu Family Estate.</p><p>At least he was an important person today and should have his own place. Forget it, there were so many delicious foods; he would try them all first.</p><p>"Who is this arrogant brat?"</p><p>"Which noble family's disciple dares to tease our sister Cai Tang?"</p><p>"What noble family? Just the son of a driver, insulting our old master in public. He was the one who fought Yu Ang in magic today," Guo Cai Tang said with disdain.</p><p>"Young people are really that arrogant these days?"</p><p>Feishi said again.</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, hmpf. He didn't even come when I invited him to my place today, who cares about him!" Guo Cai Tang's cheeks flushed red as she hurriedly defended herself in a low voice.</p><p>(wuwozijideshoudeyisi, zheyebanyitianmeiyouzaishuhoumianqiutuijianpiao, wogebainimenyebainiantianshujing, ninmenkefoubiyiwentiuijianbangniubade-rensheng?)</p>
