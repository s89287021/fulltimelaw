						<p>Cold, like countless tiny needles piercing into his skin without end, he felt as if his blood had frozen and was unable to circulate through his body.</p><p>Ye Xinxia's breathing in the freezer had become slower, and the rise and fall of her chest was visibly decreasing.</p><p>Coldness and exhaustion intertwined, it seemed she could just close her eyes and fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>"If I fall asleep, I'll never wake up again..." Ye Xinxia bit her lip fiercely to bring herself back to reality.</p><p>The two giant-eyed rats still showed no sign of leaving; their noisy sounds echoed nearby.</p><p>Ye Xinxia had no idea how long she could hold on. To her, it was better to become a frozen corpse in this place than to be the food for those giant-eyed rats.</p><p>The air began to thin out. Ye Xinxia tried to adjust her breathing but found her mind wandering uncontrollably.</p><p>......</p><p>......</p><p>The metal of the main door was heavily dented with several deep marks, and one could even hear the sound of the black beasts' claws rubbing against it continuously.</p><p>These black beasts obeyed their master's commands without question. They knew Mo Fan was hiding inside; they would not leave until they had torn him apart with their own hands.</p><p>The sharp claws slowly tore open some gaps in the metal door. Once a crack appeared, destroying the entire door became much easier. The black beasts, upon tearing a hole, shouted excitedly as if seeing a glimmer of hope, and then took turns rubbing the door with their claws.</p><p>Inside the room, Mo Fan, already wounded in several places, sat there, completely ignoring the impending danger.</p><p>He could hear the sound of the door being forced open and the black beasts' screams becoming clearer through the widening gaps.</p><p>However, what use is being heart-pounding and spine-chilling? Whether one can survive depends on the two particles in their spiritual world!!</p><p>The purple particle and the red particle emit a fluctuating light. Surrounding these particles is a faint light screen that encapsulates them, with the light emanating from within the particles aiming to break through this hazy screen.</p><p>The light screen resembles an eggshell or a cocoon, enveloping the energy about to emerge. Though it seems motionless under the impact of mana, it swells noticeably due to the internal energy surging within.</p><p>"Break for me!!!"</p><p>Mofan shouted in his heart.</p><p>On his chest, the glow from the little mud loach pendant seemed to inject a force into Mofan's particles, causing them to suddenly converge from their scattered positions!</p><p>Like countless tiny rivers converging into one mighty river, the tranquil river erupted instantly, with surging waves crashing against the embankment!!</p><p>The outer cocoon finally developed cracks, which spread in an irregular spiderweb pattern, growing larger and larger.</p><p>Success is within reach!! Success is within reach!!</p><p>Mofan's heart began to race. However, as he frantically tried to break through to the next realm, he felt his spirit bearing the brunt of tremendous energy rebounding, causing excruciating pain in his head.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Mofan believed he could not endure it. The spiritual shock feedback was like swords piercing his brain at times and like an ocean churning under a storm at others. This mental agony was something Mofan had never experienced during his cultivation; it was thousands of times more intense than the exhaustion of expending all his energy, resembling torture and torment in a nightmare...</p><p>Should there be even a momentary slackening or fainting of resolve during this process, all offensive power would instantly dissipate, forcing him to start over from scratch!!</p><p>Mofan felt like his head was about to explode, with veins bulging on his face. Yet, he dared not give up.</p><p>In fact, this pain was no less than being torn into pieces by a black beast demon. Those with weaker willpower abandoned at the outset, but Mofan clenched his teeth and persevered through it all.</p><p>When he closed his eyes, the last scene he saw was that of a girl huddled on the brink of death. If she were torn into pieces by a giant-eyed rat, he was certain he would bear a thousand times, nay, ten thousand times more pain for the rest of his life.</p><p>The mental anguish intensified, reaching five times its original magnitude!!</p><p>Mo Fan gritted his teeth and persevered.</p><p>Ten times!</p><p>Mo Fan rolled his tongue back, fearing that his body might involuntarily bite through it.</p><p>In the realm of spirit, the wind was howling, and the waves were surging.</p><p>The purple stardust and fiery stardust seemed on the verge of extinction. They suddenly dimmed in this vast and turbulent spiritual world.</p><p>The light grew weaker, weaker than a distant star, ready to vanish into the blackness of night.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan abruptly opened his eyes!</p><p>Those pupils did not dilate like those of a human; instead, they seemed to hold an infinite universe within, with the deepest depths filled with increasingly faint lightning and fiery stardust.</p><p>As the pupils dilated further, Mo Fan's entire face trembled.</p><p>The two large stardusts that were about to fall into silence suddenly emitted the most scorching radiance, flooding Mo Fan's entire spiritual cosmos at an incredible speed.</p><p>A dazzling purple so brilliant it could illuminate an entire universe, beautiful and awe-inspiring.</p><p>A searing red so intense it could ignite all darkness, sparkling and surging.</p><p>They flew, they enveloped, as if creating their own new miniature universe, their own celestial home.</p><p>Yet this time, the creation was no longer a tiny stardust like a firefly in a corner; they created a cluster of stars resembling clouds, each one brimming with radiant light, each one reflecting off one another!!</p><p>"Stardust becomes a nebula!!!"</p><p>Feeling everything, Mo Fan's entire blood boiled.</p><p>Stardust is merely a tiny speck of dust in the universe; they exist but are incredibly insignificant, providing only limited energy to wizards.</p><p>However, nebulae and stardust are vastly different. A vast expanse of stars, their brilliance can be described as luminous. They are so clearly visible in the immense spiritual cosmos, adorning a chaotic spiritual world!!!</p><p>The difference between dust and clouds is truly stark. If each small star contains magic energy, then how much energy would these densely packed star clouds hold? What kind of powerful magic could they create!!!</p><p>Within the nebulae, there are still stars that serve as the focal point for wizards casting spells.</p><p>Unlike at the initial stage, this bright nebula contains a total of 49 such stars!</p><p>These stars move rapidly within the nebula, like Mo Fan's awakening in the beginning, causing dizziness to behold.</p><p>...</p><p>"This feeling..." Mo Fan looked at his hands with disbelief.</p><p>On his left hand, the flame power eager to be released from his body burned across his entire arm, as if there was an inexhaustible supply of magic energy!</p><p>On his right hand, purple arcs covered it like ivy, competing with the flames for attention. Proud and arrogant, they seemed eager to showcase their strength like a child craving recognition.</p>
