						<p>"Damn, this old guy Mu Zhuoyun is really putting his money where his mouth is. Can you even count how many magical artifacts and magical tools he has on him?" Deng Kai almost jumped out of his chair when he saw this.</p><p>Principal Zhu shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Most of their students couldn't match the disciples from the aristocratic families, not only in cultivation level but also in equipment quality.</p><p>During this coming-of-age ceremony alone, Mu Zhuoyun must have given Yao Ang numerous magical tools and artifacts.</p><p>What about Mo Fan?</p><p>Apart from the scythe bone shield taken away from Zhan Kong, does he seem to have anything else?</p><p>How are we supposed to fight!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Principal Zhu and many other school officials felt a chill.</p><p>"Deng Kai, since you witnessed this duel, you will be the judge for this match," Mu Zhuoyun smiled slightly, already looking forward to watching the humiliation of the weak by the strong.</p><p>Deng Kai didn't know what to say; he could only silently pray for Mo Fan's safety.</p><p>"You two are both outstanding young mages. This duel is just to encourage you to train more diligently... In short, stop at a light touch!" Deng Kai stood between the two young mages and said loudly enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>Deng Kai took a slight step back but did not completely leave the arena.</p><p>From this position, he could intervene immediately if anything unexpected happened.</p><p>"Alright, shake hands. You can start once I give you my signal." Deng Kai said.</p><p>Mo Fan and Yao Ang walked towards each other, extending their hands.</p><p>A trace of cold ice condensed in Yao Ang's palm, and as soon as Mo Fan shook his hand, he could feel a chilly sensation seeping deep into his bones.</p><p>Mo Fan reacted quickly, his arm inexplicably turning red. The flames protected his muscles, veins, and bones as he calmly raised the middle finger with his other hand to You Ang.</p><p>“You’re really a little mouse who knows nothing. But it doesn’t matter; I’ll freeze all the water in your brain into ice. That might make you more awake.”</p><p>You Ang released his grip, turned around, and stood at Mo Fan’s position with a sinister laugh.</p><p>“Two-penis.” Mo Fan retorted.</p><p>Turning back to his designated spot, Mo Fan involuntarily closed his eyes.</p><p>As he turned to return to his specified location, Mo Fan unconsciously scanned the surroundings.</p><p>The moment he stepped into this mansion, he could no longer remember how many eyes had shown mockery and sympathy towards him. How many people had praised his courage on their lips while secretly smiling with disdain, thinking “he is overestimating himself, trying to break eggs against a rock.”</p><p>In this world, there were always some who thought themselves wise, watching everything he did as an outsider, feeling glad at other people’s misfortune. They were trapped in their ordinary cages, living in systems they believed no one could escape from. Thus, they wished everyone else would be like them and mocked those daring to take risks with their self-righteous experiences and narrow-mindedness.</p><p>Some people just loved gloating, just couldn’t stop babbling, just had to show off their limited intelligence and superiority...</p><p>Today, he would make all of them shut up!</p><p>“Fighting, begin!” With a command, Deng Kai officially declared the start of the long-awaited magic duel between Mo Fan.</p><p>In the next second, Mo Fan’s pupils instantly shot out fiery red beams. Within these beams, seven fiery stars could be clearly seen forming a star trail.</p><p>Star Trail Shines, Magic Appears!</p><p>A ball of flames erupted in Mo Fan’s palm, hot flame spirits jumping and dancing excitedly, eagerly to ignite everything flammable around them!</p><p>“Flame Thrive · Burn!”</p><p>Mo Fan’s speed in forming the star trail was incredibly fast, even before Deng Kai’s announcement echoed in everyone’s ears.</p><p>Such proficient release naturally caused a small amount of astonishment among those present.</p><p>"He still has some skills, the problem is that this Level 1 Fire Surge doesn't work at all."</p><p>"Why is it strange? Didn't this guy already master Fire Surge: Bone Burn? Why did he use Level 1 Fire Surge: Scorch instead? The power of Bone Burn is much greater than Scorch. Since he can seize the initiative in casting spells, why not go all out?"</p><p>Coach Luo Yunbo immediately voiced his confusion.</p><p>Anyone with even a slight understanding of Mo Fan knew that he was the first person in the entire school to master a Level 2 basic magic spell. At the time, Fire Surge: Bone Burn had shown its might during trials. Why would he use just a Fire Surge: Scorch on such an important duel?</p><p>Meanwhile, Yu Ang didn't seem at all flustered. He watched Mo Fan complete his Stellar Track as if saying, "So what if you finish your spell first?"</p><p>"Ice Vine!" Without waiting any longer, Yu Ang controlled all the stars with his mind.</p><p>Equally proficient, a wave of cold air surrounded Yu Ang in his dignified white robe.</p><p>"Ice Vine: Condensation!"</p><p>Yu Ang continued to chant the name of his spell. Instantly, the temperature in the entire duel arena plummeted, transforming from scorching summer heat into freezing winter.</p><p>Snow and frost drifted, countless ice threads and froth dancing in the air.</p><p>White frost descended upon Mo Fan's area. Given Ice Vine's freezing speed, if Mo Fan stood in the Ice Vine area for just three seconds, his lower body would surely freeze solid.</p><p>Ice Vine was a very advantageous skill in combat.</p><p>At the basic level, apart from wind and earth magic users, everyone basically lacked quick movement skills.</p><p>The range of Ice Vine always covered an entire area. Once it descended, once frost blanketed the ground, mages had to escape within three seconds or be frozen solid. Those who weren't fast enough couldn't escape this icy territory at all.</p><p>Yu Ang's Ice Vine enveloped the large area where Mo Fan was located. Even if Mo Fan ran at full speed with all his might, he wouldn't be able to escape the range of Ice Vine in just three seconds. Therefore, after three seconds, Mo Fan would become a human-shaped target.</p><p>Following that, Yu Ang released another layer of Ice Vine. In the next three seconds, Mo Fan would turn into an ice statue that elicited roars of laughter from everyone in the arena!</p><p>There was no way around it; ice magic was indeed quite mindless when dealing with mages and demons who weren't very agile. Because Ice Vine was the least technically demanding yet most practical among all basic magic spells!</p><p>"Damn, is this kid stupid? Why is he still standing there?"</p><p>"If it were me, I would run like crazy. If I got frozen, I'd just end it."</p><p>Mo Fan didn't run. Normally, a magician with some common sense would move away when facing ice vines to avoid getting frozen.</p><p>"Wanna freeze me??" Mo Fan now had a grin on his face.</p><p>The flame in his palm wasn't directed at You Ang at all. In fact, he knew very well that this tiny level 1 fire skill was absolutely incapable of defeating You Ang. He had his own clever use for this Fire Scorch: Burn!</p>
