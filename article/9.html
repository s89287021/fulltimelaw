						<p>"Four stars now, let's control five at once; it’s even harder. Sigh, I wonder if I can manage to control these seven little brats before the end of this semester and connect them into a star trail… Speaking of which, Monkey said he can only practice controlling for one hour each week, and any extra five minutes makes him collapse. I don't know why I could start with two hours; could it be due to awakening dual disciplines?"</p><p>"Controlling a star should consume the same amount of blue mana as before, so my blue mana is twice as much as Monkey's?"</p><p>Each magical student has limited mental energy. Every attempt to control a star consumes their mental energy. With the current level of mental energy among the students, it seems that most can only practice controlling for one hour…</p><p>The additional hour of practice time, combined with Mo Fan's daily efforts, has already put him far ahead of his peers. Even Mu Bai, who is the best in class, can only control three stars according to what Mo Fan’s lackey said.</p><p>Seven stars will make it perfect; Mo Fan has already controlled four and hopes to break through to five this week. It seems that awakening dual disciplines not only allows him to use two accounts but also gives him more time before becoming addicted!</p><p>This is a perfect advantage!!</p><p>Becoming the best in life and marrying a wealthy beauty is just around the corner!</p><p>…</p><p>Classes start at eight sharp, with the first lesson being Demonology. The teacher for the Demonology course is Mr. Zhang Jianguo, who happens to be the class monitor of the adjacent class.</p><p>As soon as Mo Fan arrived late, Mr. Zhang Jianguo didn’t hesitate to scold him.</p><p>Mo Fan couldn’t help rolling his eyes. This teacher really never stops, mentioning that lightning-affinity student almost every lesson.</p><p>That so-called Zhaoting is the boy who awakened Thunderbolt at the opening ceremony. Every day, Mr. Zhang likes to bring him up, and despite his stern expression, a hint of pride can't be hidden.</p><p>"That guy has controlled four stars; I already have six and just need one more step." Mo Fan thought dismissively but didn’t say it out loud. He simply walked leisurely to his seat.</p><p>"Alright, open your Demonology books. Today, I will continue discussing some common demons. As you all know, demons are distributed outside the cities where humans live, posing a great threat to humanity. They roam around and fight each other… So what should a mage do if they encounter a one-eyed wolf in the wilderness?"</p><p>Mr. Zhang Jianguo started his lecture enthusiastically.</p><p>One-eyed wolf.</p><p>This is a demon that inhabits the wild areas closest to human cities. Mo Fan has only seen its general appearance through bookmarks and videos, and it had a very savage look. </p><p>Ordinary people are unable to deal with this creature; only magicians can fight against them. Of course, for these groups of magic students who have not yet released any skill at all, the appearance of a one-eyed wolf demon would mean a bloody massacre!</p><p>The one-eyed wolf demon is the main focus in the Demonology class. Zhang Jianguo has spent an entire week studying this demon, and Mo Fan was already tired of it.</p><p>The problem is that the seventh star is particularly difficult to handle. It's like a chaste maiden, unwilling to be wooed softly or forcefully, leaving Mo Fan in great distress!</p><p>It's just one step away!!</p><p>"The same old thing," Mo Fan replied casually.</p><p>Fire Series...</p><p>As Zhang Jianguo said, Mo Fan still can't control any Fire Series stars yet.</p><p>There was nothing he could do about it. This semester, he had devoted all his energy to mastering the Large Room's Thunder Series.</p><p>"Really? It seems your foundation has really affected your training. I heard that Mu Bai already controls four Ice Series stars. If he works harder over the winter break, he might be able to release the Ice Series basic skill 'Icicle' in the next semester."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"Brother, why aren't you worried at all? Let me tell you, he and his lackey Zhao Kun are already plotting how to give you a taste of it."</p><p>"It's fine. Let them come."</p><p>Right now, Mo Fan's mind was filled with figuring out how to control the seventh star; he treated everything else as if it were air.</p><p>Sigh, in any case, be careful... This semester is almost over. Fan Ge, you have to work harder next semester. If you fail the final magic release exam at the end of next semester, the principal might find various reasons to encourage you to drop out.</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>The semester passed quickly. Mo Fan faintly felt that the seventh star was about to be moved by his sincerity.</p><p>"F*ck, it's more troublesome to cultivate than to serve a goddess. Constant inquiries and communication..."</p><p>Mo Fan complained as he walked out of school.</p><p>Throughout this entire semester, Mo Fan barely left the campus. He practiced control for two hours each day, followed by ten hours of meditation, then attended classes, had meals, and went to sleep. Every day was non-stop.</p><p>Regardless, the semester was over. After receiving their winter break assignments, the students all returned home.</p><p>Exiting the school gate, Mo Fan almost instinctively got on a bus to go home, but when he came to his senses, he suddenly felt lost.</p><p>He nearly forgot that his father had already sold the house. He was basically homeless.</p><p>Father Mo Jiasheng was probably still driving somewhere. Without anywhere to go, Mo Fan thought it was time to visit his aunt and see Xinxia.</p><p>It had been almost six months since he last saw Xinxia. He wondered how she was doing at his aunt's place.</p><p>"I'll just pick her up from school."</p><p>Mo Fan got on the bus and headed for another middle school.</p><p>Sitting in the bus, Mo Fan idly continued practicing control to see if the seventh star would obediently submit.</p><p>Stars of different constellations had different temperaments. Some were easier to deceive; Mo Fan could usually get them to follow his orders after a few nights of sweet talk. But some were especially short-tempered and hard to touch, and might even cause mental backlash, which brought intense mental pain and increased the consumption of spiritual energy several times over.</p><p>This seventh star that Mo Fan couldn't control was one of the short-tempered types. It attacked at the slightest provocation, just as difficult to serve as an aunt.</p><p>Fortunately, the relationship between the two parties has seen significant progress recently. The impulsive Xingzi gradually showed signs of being willing to listen, or else Mo Fan would have really cried; he had spent nearly a whole month on this seventh star.</p><p>(Tencent Literature's homepage features our theme song for "Full-Time Mage," which is a very nice tune. The girl's voice is very clear and crisp. You can find it on the homepage in the media library of the Full-Time Mage section. Everyone, go listen to it~~)</p>
