						<p>"Really... sigh, why didn't this student get assigned to my class and ended up with Zhang Jianguo? Now Zhang Jianguo has found a gem."</p><p>Teacher Xue Musheng's face was filled with envy and jealousy.</p><p>Mu Bai at the front looked surprised but then became more sullen and disdainful.</p><p>Lei Thunder is impressive, but if he didn't know how to cultivate, he would still be a failure. With such a large population in China, it's not surprising to have some powerful bloodlines. He's not like those prodigies born with dual bloodlines. Hmph, wait till I crush you; daring to steal the spotlight from me.</p><p>"Wow, wow, it's Fire! "</p><p>"What a surprise, our class has another Fire user."</p><p>"Who said he would fail his awakening? Turns out it's Fire. So enviable!"</p><p>The storm caused by Lei Thunder's appearance gradually calmed down, and everyone finally noticed Mo Fan's awakened bloodline.</p><p>That girl who had previously awakened the Flame System, Zhou Min, looked a little surprised and glanced at Mo Fan closely, noticing that flames appeared on his awakening stone, which seemed even more vigorous than hers.</p><p>"Another Fire user in Class 8."</p><p>"Though not as rare as Lei Thunder, Fire is still powerful!"</p><p>"F... Fire..." Teacher Xue Musheng stared blankly at this student.</p><p>The appearance of Lei Thunder made Teacher Xue Musheng almost forget about this problem student. He thought the student would fail his awakening but was surprised to find out he succeeded. Even more surprisingly, he awakened an outstanding Fire System!!</p><p>This... This is also finding a gem!!</p><p>And judging by the vigor of the flames, it seems his talent might be even higher than Zhou Min's.</p><p>Xue Musheng truly did not expect that the student he had thought would drag the class backward would suddenly become his pride! "Not bad, not bad, very good. What's your name... oh, Mu Fan, right!" Xue Musheng squinted with delight. "Mm-hmm." Mu Fan nodded. Mu Fan initially thought someone had seen him awaken his Thunder System, but when he looked around, he unexpectedly discovered that no one had noticed his previous awakening of the Thunder System... Perhaps the Thunder System's appearance in the neighboring class was indeed too shocking, or maybe the power of his awakened Thunder System was too weak. The strength at the initial awakening does matter, but it is not decisive. Even if the system awakened initially was relatively weak, it could be gradually made up for through later efforts and cultivation. "Fire System student, mm-hmm, you must work hard in the future. Ask me anything you don't understand, teacher." Class monitor Xue Musheng patted Mu Fan's shoulder and said with great satisfaction. Mu Fan was still in a state of wild joy. However, he did not become overly arrogant. If it were an ordinary teenager, they would probably have wanted to immediately show off their just-awakened Thunder System, completely outshining that Thunder System guy. Mu Fan did not do that; heaven envied talented people, let alone humans? Mu Fan knew that someone on the Mu family side had a great deal of animosity towards him. If he showed his innate dual systems, he would either have to submit or be eliminated. He possessed unparalleled dual systems, but he was still too weak. There was no rush; he could become rampant when he became stronger! Mu Fan turned back to observe the reactions of Mu Bai and Zhao Kun San. Indeed, both of these guys' faces were twitching! "What kind of **** luck did this kid get? Not only did he awaken successfully, but it's the Fire System!" Mu Bai, who appeared upright and righteous, was inwardly spouting profanity. "Holy crap, how is this possible? Fire System..." The sycophant Zhao Kun San was also dumbfounded. "Haha, I told you that Brother Mu Fan would be extraordinary. Fire System, awesome, it's just awesome. You, Zhao Kun San, a Wind System user, are nothing." Zhang Hou jumped up in joy and felt the urge to take a bite out of sycophant Zhao Kun San.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan's face was filled with anger. If the wind element had initially competed against the fire flame element, it would definitely be at a disadvantage!</p><p>Mo Fan turned around with a carefree smile on his face. Basking in the sunlight, he felt as if a carpet had been laid out beneath him. The two girls beside him shrieked; his arrogance could not be described in any other way.</p><p>As he walked past Mu Bai, Mo Fan silently raised his middle finger at him, completing the gesture of disdain without a hint of awkwardness, making it look like he was simply greeting him.</p><p>Mu Bai felt as though he had been hit with a full set of ridicule skills that left him breathless. His chest felt like it was about to explode.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Mu Bai told himself to maintain his image. He couldn't let himself get caught up in the same petty mindsets as this little punk. After all, he was half a son-in-law of the Mu family, while this guy was just the son of a servant.</p><p>"Not only did that good-for-nothing awaken successfully, but it was also the fire element, which has significant advantages early on. Even scoundrels have their lucky breaks... and what really pissed me off was that a rare lightning element appeared in the neighboring class, completely overshadowing my inherited ice element. Damn it!"</p><p>On the surface, Mu Bai seemed like a prince charming, but deep down, his mind was already filled with curses.</p><p>Mo Fan returned to his seat and also felt the different gazes from his classmates...</p><p>"Fire element, try not to provoke this guy in the future."</p><p>"Why avoid provoking him? You should build good relations. As an elemental light user, I need support from a fire element big brother if I want to survive in school."</p><p>"What's his name again? Is it Mo Fan?"</p><p>The students whispered among themselves, and their words reached Mo Fan's ears. He felt refreshed and specifically glanced at Mu Bai, who was also listening. Sure enough, the corners of Mu Bai's mouth were twitching.</p><p>Mo Fan had always known what kind of person Mu Bai was. This guy pretended to be a hipster all day long; one could tell by his fake carefree expression that he was extremely uncomfortable inside.</p><p>Hipster boy, you got this mad when I awakened fire? Wait till you find out about my thunder element... shouldn't you have gutted yourself by now??</p>
