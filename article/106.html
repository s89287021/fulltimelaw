						<p>"I wasn't joking. Do you think I could safely arrive here carrying such a scattered thing as the Earth Holy Spring? With the Earth Holy Spring, I would be like Tang Seng's flesh, attracting all kinds of demons and monsters... But I dared not easily throw it away, fearing something might happen. It just so happened that at that moment, I was feeling quite thirsty, so I drank it in one go, leaving not a drop behind," Mo Fan said seriously.</p><p>After saying this, Mo Fan took out the bottle containing the Earth Holy Spring and casually threw it to Zhan Kong.</p><p>Zhan Kong caught the empty bottle and deliberately looked inside it, his facial expression more varied than ever before.</p><p>R-Really drank it??</p><p>Not even someone born into a military family and wielding state power had been so extravagant like this, right!</p><p>Zhan Kong took a few steps back to avoid losing balance and falling down.</p><p>After a while, Zhan Kong finally came to his senses and said helplessly, "Before the disaster, you would have been put on the stake for cremation; there would be no difference from the Black Church... However, Mu Zhuoyun, Yang Zuohhe, Old Zhu, Deng Kai, and I were all merely hoping that the Earth Holy Spring would not fall into the hands of the Black Church. As for the Earth Holy Spring... it will dry up in the coming years, and it won't last much longer. If we don't have it, we don't have it. The most important thing is to protect Bocity."</p><p>"I had a similar premonition, so I drank it directly. Anyway, if the Black Church finds me, they would at most find a particularly foul-smelling urine in my corpse," Mo Fan said with a grin.</p><p>"You brat..." Zhan Kong laughed and shook his head.</p><p>Zhan Kong did not overly dwell on the whereabouts of the Earth Holy Spring; in fact, he might not entirely believe what Mo Fan said. However, given that this nearly depleted Earth Holy Spring brought more disaster than blessing to Bocity now, if it were secretly kept by the naughty brat Mo Fan, then it could be seen as his reward for saving Bocity. After all, as a student who had not graduated from senior three and was still able to protect such an important thing, even exposing traitors like Bai Yang, if it were anyone else, the Earth Holy Spring would probably have fallen into the hands of the Black Church.</p><p>It didn't matter whether he drank it or kept it hidden.</p><p>Since they were certain that the Earth Holy Spring had not fallen into the hands of the Black Church and were only facing a Leader-level Winged Gray Wolf, it was time to cut off this menace!</p><p>Whoever dares to invade my city will be punished with death, no matter how strong they are. No matter where you run, I, Zhan Kong, will definitely take your head as a sacrifice for the souls of Bocity's fallen!"</p><p>"Execute orders!" With eyes like lightning, Zhan Kong suddenly barked.</p><p>The mid-level military mages standing on both sides instantly changed their posture into military formation, and a sense of killing intent instantly permeated the howling gale.</p><p>"Kill the Winged Gray Wolf until it is dead! Die or die!" Zhan Kong roared again, his voice filled with killing intent.</p><p>"Kill Yi Canglang, no rest until death!"</p><p>"Kill Yi Canglang, no rest until death!"</p><p>"Kill..."</p><p>After the iron-clad voice dissipated into the wind, the military leader Zhan Kong took a forward step, his green military jacket billowing high in the gale.</p><p>As he fell, Leader Zhan Kong plummeted from the towering lookout tower. Before Mo Fan could recover from his shock, he saw a pair of milky white wings appear abruptly in the distant view...</p><p>Wind Wings!!</p><p>This was Mo Fan's second time seeing Wind Wings, and the inner awe remained as profound as ever.</p><p>The gray sky, bloodstained city, between heaven and earth—a figure supported by the wings of gale winds, how majestic and unrestrained it was...</p><p>He dared to say kill Yi Canglang!</p><p>He dared to say that he would protect this city!!</p><p>...</p><p>"Huhuhuhu~~~~~~~~~~~~~~" The wind from flapping wings slapped Mo Fan in the face.</p><p>After Zhan Kong soared away, his nine subordinates leaped down one after another. Soon, Mo Fan saw nine white eagles carrying isolated backs of officers flying towards the Silver Trade Building in the gray sky.</p><p>Those were Thunder Eagles reserved for high-ranking officers, and they were also a symbol of the military.</p><p>When Fangshankongling Fengzhiyi led the charge, he was the first to go. As the nine eagles carrying officers soared overhead, a thunderous roar echoed throughout the entire safety barrier as the guardians responded in unison.</p><p>This disaster would finally come to an end.</p><p>On this blood-red day of alert, humans were playing the roles of food, fugitives, weaklings, and fearful beings, but that did not mean they were truly helpless, mere poultry penned up within city walls!!</p><p>There was a type of people among humans—they were called mages!</p><p>Their duty was to fight with the power bestowed upon them by nature when demons invaded human cities.</p><p>Fiercely…</p><p>Ferociously strike down the demons!</p><p>…</p><p>Under the safety barrier, there was a young man whose body was tinged with tea color.</p><p>He sat helplessly among the protected crowd, so ordinary, so bewildered.</p><p>However, when he raised his head and saw the towering figure above the city, the nine white streaks of the eagles, and the high cries of the military mages at the edge of the safety barrier—like drums beating the signal for counterattack—his eyes were completely captivated by the scene. His pupils dilated continuously.</p><p>Since the moment Heyu died, his eyes had lost all expression; now, they felt as if they would burn!!</p><p>His heart surged with the rhythm of the counterattack drums and found its direction in the ten resolute figures heading towards Yicanglang.</p><p>"If you could know that the weak boy I saved would one day become a military mage guarding an entire city, using his own strength to save tens of thousands of girls like you, even you in paradise would be smiling with satisfaction."</p><p>The weak boy clenched his fists. He already knew where he needed to go and what he would do in the future.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Fan descended from the lookout tower and, upon reaching the bottom, caught sight of Instructor Pan LiJun.</p><p>Pan LiJun had always had a stern expression on her face. Today, she seemed to have a lingering sorrow etched between her brows, making her appear somewhat haggard despite her usually sharp features.</p><p>"So you mean that the sudden appearance of so many demons in Bocheng is likely due to several underground tunnels directly connecting our city's sewers to areas outside? The demons are using these underground passageways to bypass our safety barriers and enter Bocheng directly?" the man with the headscarf said solemnly.</p><p>"That's correct. Our immediate priority is to find those demon cave entrances and seal and destroy the underground tunnels, otherwise, demons will keep flooding into Bocheng," he added.</p><p>"However, we currently have no idea where these demon entries leading to our city are located," Pan LiJun was equally at a loss.</p><p>The demon attack had been so sudden that the entire city fell into chaos. Finding the demons' underground entry points in this vast city was no easy task.</p><p>Their conversation triggered an epiphany in Mo Fan's mind!</p><p>Caves, tunnels, sewers... this suggested that there were powerful digging creatures at work!!</p><p>Giant-Eyed Rats!!!</p><p>Over the past year with the demon-hunting team, Mo Fan and his comrades had hunted down countless Giant-Eyed Rats running rampant in Bocheng.</p><p>At this moment, he finally understood why the Giant-Eyed Rats had been so rampant in Bocheng over the past year.</p><p>Oh my God, there were signs of disaster for Bocheng all along!!!</p><p>(The evening traffic prevented me from uploading the chapter directly. This is Chapter 1 today, and Chapter 2 will be uploaded at midnight tonight.)</p>
