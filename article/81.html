						<p>"Let Yuang end it. If his face freezes, his breathing will stop, putting him in danger of life," said Principal Zhu as if he already knew the outcome. He then turned to Deng Kai.</p><p>"Don't worry, don't worry. Fire-affiliated students aren't that easily killed by ice and snow." Mu Zhuoyun was rubbing his beard happily.</p><p>Looking around at the guests, each one of them looked stunned.</p><p>Hahaha, you guys never thought Yuang would master 3rd Level Icevine just when he turned eighteen!</p><p>Generally speaking, in Tianlan Magic High School, students who could master their 2nd Level skills before graduation were already considered quite exceptional. Such students, if they also had high cultivation scores, mostly went on to prestigious magic universities.</p><p>As for the 3rd Level skill, it would take many more years to learn!</p><p>His foster son Yuang, however, mastered it at 18, completely outshining Tianlan Magic High School's 1,500 students and even surpassing other factions' heirs.</p><p>Mo Fan, this little fellow, really overestimates himself. Even if you bash your head in, I Mu Zhuoyun won't let you off easily. Let him curse, let him curse. Didn't he curse to his heart's content back then? Can't I cure you, this little punk?</p><p>"Still, the Mu family produces talents. Truly admirable."</p><p>"Brother Zhuoyun, your move was quite unexpected. A 3rd Level Icevine, well hidden. Fortunately, I didn't let my son spar with your Yuang; otherwise, his fate would have been the same as this poor student's." a matron said with a chuckle.</p><p>"Sigh, once the 3rd Level Icevine appeared, it essentially dominated Bo City's young generation. Indeed, heroes come from the youth."</p><p>The shock value of a 3rd Level Icevine was indeed formidable, making the battle practically one-sided. The guests began to congratulate and flatter Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun enjoyed it thoroughly. Throwing a grand coming-of-age ceremony was all about showing Bo City's people the strength of his Mu family's younger generation.</p><p>"Deng Kai, that's enough."</p><p>Principal Zhu still cared more about Mo Fan in the end.</p><p>"Deng Kai, why haven't you called a stop to this? Mo Fan has no magical equipment to resist. If blood supply is delayed for any longer, it will have a significant impact on him."</p><p>In the arena, Deng Kai also wanted to stop this extremely one-sided battle, but the sudden appearance of a blazing flame in the midst of the vast ice and snow abruptly quashed that thought.</p><p>"Old Zhu, this Mo Fan is probably not as simple as we imagine," Deng Kai said sternly, his eyes fixed on Mo Fan.</p><p>Principal Zhu was filled with confusion. Just as he was about to speak, a dazzling flame caught his attention in the midst of the boundless snow and ice.</p><p>Should he persist with completing a Fire Infusion under these conditions?</p><p>However, Fire Infusion: Bone Burn would lose much of its power under this massive layer of frost. Even if its strength were not diminished, Principal Zhu did not believe that Yu Ang had no defensive magical tools at all.</p><p>In other words, even if Mo Fan completed a Fire Infusion in his final moments of freezing, his Fire Infusion would be blocked by Yu Ang's unused defensive magical tool. Such a struggle...</p><p>No, something was amiss!</p><p>This Fire Infusion...</p><p>This was not a Level 2 Fire Infusion: Bone Burn!!</p><p>Despite its small size, this ball of fire had unparalleled penetration power and scorching intensity; the surrounding ice and snow were unable to cool it down at all!</p><p>The Fire Infusion landed again in front of Yu Ang, who was controlling the snow and ice.</p><p>Yu Ang sneered and used his mental will to search for a defensive magical tool within his spirit world.</p><p>"Ice Particle Shield!"</p><p>Yu Ang awakened the shield-type magical tool imprint connected to his soul. In an instant, the frost particles gathered, forming a curved ice particle large shield in front of him. This ice shield was sufficient to completely protect Yu Ang from behind.</p><p>All the guests present sighed or laughed at this scene.</p><p>Why bother with such a futile battle? You, a zero-yuan player, can really defeat a Renminbi player?</p><p>"Fire Thrive..."</p><p>"Explosion!!"</p><p>Amidst the frigid, emotionless snowfields, a majestic incantation suddenly echoed throughout the arena and beyond.</p><p>Scarcely had the words left his mouth when an unexpected splash of crimson appeared in the sea of white before them.</p><p>The crimson started as faint as a candlelight but erupted with a deafening boom in the very next second.</p><p>"BOOM~~~~~~~~!!"</p><p>Without warning, flames burst forth violently.</p><p>Wave after wave of fire rolled outward from the point where Fire Thrive had landed, searing tongues of flame dancing wildly.</p><p>Blinding red, swirling heat waves; the air was resonant with the blast, and the ripples reached all the way to the spectators' seats.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded, their eyes locked onto that blinding fire explosion.</p><p>Oh my God!!</p><p>This wasn't Fire Thrive - Bone Burning!!</p><p>It was Fire Thrive - Explosion!!</p><p>A Tier 3 Fire-type skill!!!</p><p>The crowd still hadn't recovered from Yuang's unexpectedly high cultivation level when Mo Fan's explosive display shook them further.</p><p>Captain Xu Dahan of the City Monster Hunt Team's eyes nearly popped out of his head.</p><p>Huo Zhi·Bao Lie can be considered his ultimate skill. With these three levels of Huo Zhi, he stands out among the Hunter Mages. The problem is that he is already nearly thirty years old as a magician, and Huo Zhi·Bao Lie was something he struggled hard to achieve. A magic student who hasn't even graduated from high school actually mastering this… This is just too unbelievable!!</p><p>Principal Zhu and Deng Kai were actually the first to notice Mo Fan's Huo Zhi, but their emotions have yet to calm down until now.</p><p>Having run the school for so many years, a student who masters three levels of Huo Zhi before graduation… They couldn't remember how long it had been since such a case appeared!!</p><p>They were still marveling at how disciples from prestigious families are indeed superior, and no matter how outstanding students from Magic High Schools are, they cannot match them. Who knew that Mo Fan would give them a huge surprise in an instant.</p><p>Is this kid some kind of freak??</p><p>In a place with limited resources like our school, he was able to reach such a level!!</p><p>Mid-level Mage Yang Zuohé from the Magic Association was already stunned. He glanced at the dazed crowd around him and couldn't help but ask, "Has anyone taken this kid away? If not, I want him!"</p><p>Zhou Mingjun of the Zhou family wasn't happy with that and immediately said, "Your Magic Association doesn't have much good Fire magic resources. Better give it to our Zhou family."</p><p>"This boy is from our Military Division. Don't snatch him," Luo Yunbo couldn't hold back any longer and rushed to speak up.</p>
