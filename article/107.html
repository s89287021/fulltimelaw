						<p>"Officer Pan, I think I know where to find some clues." Mo Fan suddenly realized something after hearing the two people's conversation and quickly spoke up.</p><p>"Where?" The two looked at Mo Fan with confusion.</p><p>"The City Monster Hunting Team," Mo Fan replied.</p><p>Their conversation seemed to trigger a fleeting thought in Mo Fan's mind.</p><p>This demon invasion appeared to have no signs, but Mo Fan, who was part of the City Monster Hunting Team, had vaguely learned about some situations in Bocity. The most obvious one was the rampant Giant-Eyed Rats!</p><p>The City Monster Hunting Team kept records every time they hunted a demon. Presumably, the whereabouts of the Giant-Eyed Rats in Bocity had revealed the location of the demon entrance to some extent!!</p><p>They exchanged glances and immediately understood.</p><p>They could obtain some accurate clues from them!</p><p>"That's great; I'll go contact someone from the City Monster Hunting Team right away," the man with a headscarf nodded firmly.</p><p>Pan Li Jun turned back to look at Mo Fan in surprise. She did not expect this student to pinpoint such important information in one sentence.</p><p>"Actually, I am a member of the Monster Hunting Team. After gaining experience and realizing that my strength was still too weak, I joined one of the City Monster Hunting Teams. However, I don't know where they are now," Mo Fan explained with a bitter smile as Officer Pan stared at him.</p><p>"You really surprised us," Pan Li Jun's face managed to show a faint smile.</p><p>"Officer Pan, is everything alright at the Xuefeng Mountain Station? My father is there," Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"Don't worry; it's safer there than in Bocity. Your father won't be in any danger," Pan Li Jun said.</p><p>"That's good. Can you do me another favor?"</p><p>"You say it, little hero."</p><p>"The safety barrier is like a large concentration camp with too many people; I can't find my family who retreated to the safety barrier. Could you help me ask where they are now?" Mo Fan said.</p><p>"Sure, no problem. It will probably take some time for Captain Cheng to find someone from the monster hunting team."</p><p>When demons entered the city, most normal communication devices were disabled.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after, Captain Cheng, wearing a headscarf, returned. Alongside him were a few people, including Xiao Ke and Xu Dahang whom Mo Fan recognized.</p><p>Xiao Ke was holding her mini notebook, rapidly checking the monster hunting diary she had input into the computer.</p><p>"We have now identified several areas where the giant-eyed monkeys have appeared before. The first is the park in Beiling District, where an aggressive giant-eyed monkey appeared. It was likely that the demons invaded the city in this district."</p><p>Captain Cheng nodded. "Beiling District is indeed occupied by demons."</p><p>"The next area is Guangshang Tianjie, followed by Lufeng Town, then..."</p><p>"Are there any noticeable caves?" Captain Cheng asked.</p><p>"Oh, yes... a cave appeared under the cafeteria of Mingwen Middle School. A female student went missing at that time. There are quite a number of demons in Mingwen District. I think there must be a demon entrance there," Xiao Ke said.</p><p>"I remember that. Fan Mo had just joined our team when we discovered a giant-eyed monkey at Mingwen Girls' High School, and then the police found a cave. Everyone suspected that the girl was dragged into the cave and eaten..."</p><p>Fei Shi hurriedly added.</p><p>As they walked, Xiao Ke and Xu Dahang clearly did not notice Mo Fan standing aside, deeply engrossed in thought.</p><p>Now the monster hunting team knew that Mo Fan was Fan Mo. They were surprised because they expected him to be cultivating at Dijingshui Temple, so why had he come here?</p><p>"Engraving District has a demon entrance, so have the people in the Engraving District evacuated?" General Cheng asked a female mage beside him.</p><p>"There is no information about any evacuation."</p><p>Everyone fell into silence for a moment.</p><p>After a long while, Xu Dahan frowned and said, "It seems that there is indeed a demon entrance in the Engraving District, and it's right at the Engraving Girls' High School. No wonder they have felt vibrations around the school as if construction was taking place for such a long time. It turns out to be the giant-eyed porcupine digging tunnels."</p><p>"No evacuation?? Did you see wrong? Are you sure there has been no evacuation????" Mo Fan stared intently at the female military mage who just spoke.</p><p>"Mo Fan, don't get too excited."</p><p>"That's right, if the demon entrance is indeed near the Engraving Girls' High School, the Engraving District will definitely be greatly affected, and evacuation would not be an easy task."</p><p>Mo Fan sank down completely.</p><p>He clearly remembered Ye Xinxia telling him that their school often experienced vibrations, which was due to the giant-eyed porcupine digging tunnels underground.</p><p>If demons were to crawl out from there, the entire school could very well be destroyed instantly.</p><p>Now that the whole city was in crisis, who would have time to manage whether a middle school evacuated or not?</p><p>"General Cheng, our priority is to send a team there; we must destroy the demon entrance as soon as possible!" Pan Lijun said.</p><p>Since they found the demon cave entrance, they naturally had to set out immediately. They did not have any extra time to waste.</p><p>"The number of people in this team cannot be too large. Those demons are not completely mindless; if they discover a large group heading towards their entrance, it will certainly attract many demons and reveal our objective." the female military mage said.</p><p>General Cheng surveyed the crowd present and said solemnly, "I'll dispatch personnel right away."</p><p>"General, I will go with you all. As the captain of the city's demon-hunting team, I am more familiar with how to fight demons in a city than you are," Xu Dahan said.</p><p>Xiao Ke glanced at Xu Dahan but was unsure whether to make a decision.</p><p>"Alright, having an elite monster-hunting team member would greatly increase our chances of success. However, this mission is extremely dangerous; everyone must be cautious," General Cheng said.</p><p>Just as they had finished discussing and were preparing to set off, a person stood before them.</p><p>"Fan Mo? No, it's Mo Fan!" Xiao Ke and Xu Dahan both expressed their surprise.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at the two of them and then looked at General Cheng, who was in charge of this mission.</p><p>Pan Li jun, standing nearby, also showed surprise. "Mo Fan, are you going to join us as well? You’ve already successfully evacuated Tiān Lán Magic High School and thwarted the Black Vatican’s plans for the Holy Spring. Now that you’re resting within a safety barrier, we can handle the rest."</p><p>"Alright, you are already a hero of this city; let alone this mission… it would be an exaggeration to describe it as a fight between life and death," General Cheng nodded.</p><p>…</p><p>A hero of the city?</p><p>Mo Fan did not think so.</p><p>If she died, he would be nothing but a complete failure!</p>
