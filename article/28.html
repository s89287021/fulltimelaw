						<p>"How?" the principal asked the three examiners.</p><p>The three examiners had not yet reported on the appearance of Dark Rock when Mu He preemptively said:</p><p>"Oh, since there's a problem, let's retest. Director Wang, go to the storage room and bring another Star Sensory Stone... This thing is useful, but it's also delicate. It can have some minor issues after being affected by different energy sources. We really should thank Teacher Tang Yue for spotting it right away; she helped us correct a mistake."</p><p>Mu He, as expected of an old fox, quickly deflected the matter and prevented the three examiners from revealing the truth.</p><p>Although Tang Yue frowned, she knew this likely had something to do with Mu He.</p><p>Announcing this would be difficult for the school leaders, and considering it might also affect the student's evaluation, they decided to keep it under wraps.</p><p>"Alright, retake."</p><p>"Retake it!"</p><p>"Mr. Mo Fan, there was a minor issue with the Star Sensory Stone, so your previous score is invalidated. We will give you another chance to retake the exam." The bald examiner, grabbing at a straw, immediately said this.</p><p>Mo Fan looked at them all as if they were a group of ugly dwarfs.</p><p>More hassle, continue with it. Grandpa is waiting for me!</p><p>"That's great, we get to retake! You'll max out at a D anyway, how could you possibly get a B? Little Brother San, we can finally leave school in high spirits," student Lu Xiaobin said excitedly.</p><p>Thank heavens for little brother Lu Xiaobin. I really should thank Teacher Tang Yue for discovering the issue in time.</p><p>Just as expected, Mo Fan, who is more of a burden than myself, couldn't have possibly turned things around.</p><p>"Teacher Tang Yue, why are you doing this? Giving students a chance isn't a bad thing," Xue Mushi said with a mix of amusement and frustration to Tang Yue.</p><p>It was really the Star Sensory Stone that had the problem; Xue Mushi felt terrible about it.</p><p>Here it comes, just as expected. The thing that hadn't been opened for three years was finally opened by a student from my class!</p><p>"Haha, how could Huang Feifeng possibly come last? Teacher Tang Yue is truly famous; I admire you so much," said Huang Feifeng, who had the same fire attribute, with great relief.</p><p>On the other hand, Mu Bai's sycophant Zhao Kun San was extremely happy too.</p><p>"He scared the hell out of me. I thought this piece of trash would actually make a comeback, but he Zhao Kun San is just an average student," Zhao Kun San continued. "Fortunately, fortunately, Mu Bai, that bad star sensing stone almost let this kid barely pass through. I find Teacher Tang Yue more and more like my dream lover." After wiping his cold sweat, he added, "Eh, Mu Bai, why are you still keeping a straight face? You haven't mentioned that he only got an average grade because of the problem with the star sensing stone, have you? Don't worry, he will definitely be expelled."</p><p>"Can you shut up, you're annoying!" said Mu Bai irritably.</p><p>...</p><p>The tests for other classes were almost over. Due to some minor issues in Class Eight's assessment, many people gathered around, including the top students from other classes.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan inadvertently became everyone's focus of attention.</p><p>"Alright, Mo Fan, you can retake the test now. Teacher Tang Yue has already checked it; is there anything wrong with it this time?" said the bald examiner in a praising manner.</p><p>"No," replied Teacher Tang Yue.</p><p>Mo Fan stood on the star sensing stone again, but this time he did not feel an icy aura hit him.</p><p>Indeed, Mu Bai and company had done something to it!</p><p>Mo Fan let out a cold snort. Fortunately, his most sexy and alluring teacher, Teacher Tang Yue, discovered it early, otherwise Mo Fan would have argued with that brat in front of the authorities!</p><p>Closing his eyes, Mo Fan placed his hand on the star sensing stone.</p><p>The coolness of the Star Sensory Stone soon warmed up under Mo Fan's stellar dust power transmission.</p><p>The radiance grew more intense, with a fiery red glow seemingly burning from within the Star Sensory Stone. This time, the radiance was not suppressed at all and was completely released, spreading around the Star Sensory Stone and even spilling out of it!!</p><p>"This… this radiance!!!"</p><p>The first person to show disbelief was Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>The principal, vice-principal, head of the political education department, and board members all widened their eyes.</p><p>"Radiance overflow!!!"</p><p>Class teacher Xue Mushi was thoroughly stunned.</p><p>Having been a teacher for so many years, how could he not understand radiance overflow??</p><p>Seemingly, only Mu Bai had reached the realm of radiance overflow in the entire school. Perhaps due to the nature of the flame itself being brighter, this overflowing fire-based radiance was even stronger than Mu Bai's ice-based glow!!!</p><p>"What the hell!!!"</p><p>Those onlookers from other classes and students from Class Eight were already trampled by the word "what the hell" in their hearts!</p><p>Radiance overflow, it really was radiance overflow!!</p><p>A student who had almost been deemed an idiotic loser actually reached the realm of radiance overflow!!!</p><p>"s……s??" </p><p>"It's s……seems to be s."</p><p>"Or… or maybe we should check again?"</p><p>They were all mad—Baldy Director Wang and the other two examiners had gone insane. Even their classmates, who had always believed Mo Fan would be expelled from school, seemed to have lost their minds.</p><p>Damn it, this must be a mistake with the Star Sensory Stone! How could he possibly reach such an advanced level?!!!</p><p>"It's an illusion, it has to be an illusion!"</p><p>"I don't believe it, I don't believe it, I don't believe it!!" Little Bin, the water elemental student, was wailing like a banshee.</p><p>Didn't we agree to graduate together?!</p><p>Forget about Mo Fan fulfilling his promise as a mediocre student. He turned into a genius in one second! This time, nobody is stopping me; I'm going to jump off the bridge. If Mo Fan can become a genius, why can't I, a water elemental mage, drown myself?!!</p><p>Mu Ningxue, who had always remained expressionless, finally showed some emotion at this moment.</p><p>Yes, even she hadn't expected the final result to be like this!</p><p>For a student without any special talent or background like Mo Fan, getting a B grade was perfectly normal.</p><p>But he achieved radiance overflow—a fire elemental radiance overflow—far surpassing Mu Bai who already had some resources and family support.</p><p>For some reason, Mu Ningxue felt a ray of sunlight within her as if the overflowing fire elemental light had spread through her heart.</p><p>"Truly astonishing, we nearly missed out on an even more outstanding student," one board member exclaimed in amazement.</p><p>"Yes, yes, you can't imagine what giving him just a B would do to his future and how much talent our school would lose."</p><p>"It's never too late to mend one's ways; Teacher Tang Yue, I must thank you for your keen observation!"</p><p>Seeing all the leaders praising her, Teacher Tang Yue merely smiled lightly.</p><p>In fact, Tang Yue herself was equally surprised.</p><p>(Realizing it was Children's Day, I knew that most of you who finished reading were elementary school students. Therefore, in order to make you happy, I decided to update one more chapter, so please consider voting for my monthly ticket!)</p>
