						<p>On the hilltop pavilion, a purple energy that was dazzling and splendid flashed briefly before vanishing swiftly. </p><p>The air was filled with a burnt smell. </p><p>The surrounding plants turned black. </p><p>Two people lay on the floor, convulsing violently in agony; their pitiful appearance bore no resemblance to the domineering figure of Guangchi's boss just moments ago.</p><p>The other three individuals had already gone mad with fear.</p><p>"D… D… Big Brother Mofan… considering that we are also fellow townspeople… please spare us our lives, we swear we will never do it again!!" The cigarette-smoking man was so terrified he had lost his mind; in his eyes, this sixteen-year-old boy was more terrifying than any demon from a nightmare!</p><p>"You… You must be an honorable mage… don't treat us like scum, please, don't harm us," the man in jeans stammered.</p><p>Seeing Xubing and the muscular man in such a state was truly horrifying!</p><p>The man in jeans did not want to end up like them!</p><p>The raging anger within Mofan gradually subsided as he completely released the Thunder Seal.</p><p>Glancing at the terribly injured Xubing and muscular man, then at the three terrified individuals, </p><p>"Take them to the hospital," Mofan calmed down. </p><p>In fact, even Mofan had not anticipated how powerful his initial stage Lightning skill—Thunder Seal—would be!</p><p>This was likely his first complete release of it; if he had been more proficient, controlled the aim better, and released it without hesitation, that single Thunder Seal might have killed all five people standing together!</p><p>Fortunately, no one died.</p><p>Otherwise, the matter might really escalate!</p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, we're leaving, we're leaving!!" The cowboy man saw that the young mage's anger had subsided and felt as if he had been reborn.</p><p>The other two people didn't dare to think much further; they hurriedly helped the two men who were already paralyzed on the ground...</p><p>However, as soon as they touched them, residual arcs shot into their arms, making them shudder in fright.</p><p>"Call an ambulance. Medical expenses are your own problem," Mo Fan said coldly.</p><p>"We will, we will."</p><p>Mo Fan's anger had subsided; in fact, there was a surge of uncontrollable excitement in his heart.</p><p>But now that he was acting like a killing machine, how could he show his elation in front of these foolish people?</p><p>Walking into the pavilion, Mo Fan swept the cards from the wheelchair cushion and carried it down the stairs.</p><p>Those three people were still watching Mo Fan with lingering fear.</p><p>Suddenly, Mo Fan turned around.</p><p>The three people hastily retreated in fright.</p><p>"Oh right, if anyone asks, say that they stole electricity themselves. As for me being a mage, if you dare to spread the word, I'll make sure you never speak again. Anyway, I've heard that the police don't really bother with mages who accidentally kill someone, especially those social outcasts who provoke wizards."</p><p>Mo Fan remembered something and warned these people.</p><p>The three people nodded vigorously, listening as obediently as possible.</p><p>"ZHAO Kun san and MU Bai's place, I think you know how to talk to them given your intelligence," Mo Fan walked away gracefully.</p><p>"We... we didn't catch you."</p><p>"Well, you're smart. This time, I'll let it slide. If anything happens in the future, you can come to me. You've seen what I'm capable of."</p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, Brother Mo Fan, slow down, take your time," said the three people, bowing and nodding in respect and fear.</p><p>First, give these brats a good lesson, then offer them a little incentive. Mo Fan believed that these fellows would no longer dare to cause trouble or leak any information about this incident.</p><p>On one side, he was already an advanced lightning mage capable of casting spells, while on the other side, there was Mu Bai, still at the apprentice level as an ice mage. He believed that even those with a little sense would know which side to choose!</p><p>However, Mo Fan was well aware that these five individuals were merely pawns for Mu Bai and Zhao Kunsan.</p><p>In the end, it would be these two morons who had to deal with the consequences!</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but burst into laughter as he walked down the stone steps!!</p><p>A few months ago, he was just an ordinary student in a classroom, often feeling bored and dull during history lessons while staring out the window. Occasionally, he would imagine himself suddenly rising on a gust of wind, lightly stepping on the flagpole, soaring to the distant sky beyond the school's hillside; or facing some bullies who relied on their menacing looks and sheer numbers, gathering a special force in his palm to crush them instantly.</p><p>Who could have imagined that he would experience this feeling today!</p><p>With the power of lightning and thunder in hand, five tough guys whom he would never dare provoke before now cowered like stray dogs before him. This was an unprecedentedly wonderful sensation, almost surreal!</p><p>"The Lightning Seal is so powerful for a Lightning Mage. I wonder what the initial skill 'Fire Surge' of a Fire Mage can do. It's only half a year until the annual magic assessment, I should have enough time to learn Fire Surge..."</p><p>Mo Fan was completely excited.</p><p>The initial skill of the Lightning Mage, Lightning Seal, was already so formidable. He wondered how powerful the skills of other magical disciplines were.</p><p>Moreover, Mo Fan knew that initial skills were the lowest level in all magic spells, with intermediate and advanced levels following.</p><p>"Oh right, right, the Wind Mage teacher mentioned in the first class that the advanced skill 'Wind Wings' allows one to fly... Damn it, if I could learn Wind Wings, what a status boost that would be!!"</p><p>After a long time, Mo Fan still couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart. His mind kept searching through all the magical knowledge he had learned to find out if there were more awesome and dazzling skills that a mage could possess besides the Thunder Seal!</p><p>...</p><p>On the stationary swing, a girl with straight, long hair was still slightly tilting her head back, staring at the small pavilion hidden by the trees.</p><p>"The purple light just now was..." Ye Xinxia muttered to herself.</p><p>She had seen the magnificent purple light, like the tail of a shooting star, shining next to that pavilion. Although it quickly faded away, the astonishing image remained imprinted in her mind.</p><p>"Was it a mage?" Ye Xinxia murmured.</p><p>It was hard for her to imagine a mage appearing in such a small urban area!</p><p>But why would a mage show up where Mo Fan and those hoodlums were, even using real magic!</p><p>Big Brother Mo Fan, is he okay??</p><p>Ye Xinxia was feeling uneasy at the moment, unconsciously biting her lip.</p>
