						<p>Mo Fan was also quite helpless.</p><p>The city of Bocheng definitely could not be stayed in any longer. Who knew if Yi Canglang would come back to kill again? The military would never send people to permanently guard this place.</p><p>Bocheng, a remote city, had developed into a small town precisely because of some very special resources. Right now, those resources were almost completely plundered by the Black Cathedral, with the most important Ground Holy Spring being directly consumed by Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan had already been invited for tea more than once over this matter. However, Yang Zuohé, Mu Zhuoyún, Zhan Kong, and others did not pursue it too much. In any case, saving the Ground Holy Spring and having so many survivors in Bocheng was a huge achievement for Mo Fan.</p><p>"Mo Fan, you are now a real man. I'll follow your advice. Wherever you decide to go is where we will go," said Mo Jiaying to Mo Fan.</p><p>"Let's go to Shanghai," Mo Fan blurted out.</p><p>The largest city in the south was naturally Shanghai. Even during the Scientific World, Mo Fan had always dreamed of making a name for himself in this supercity. It was certain that the Magic City of Shanghai would be the capital that countless magicians across the country aspired to!</p><p>"The cost of living in Shanghai is very high. I'll first check if there are any resettlement houses provided by Shanghai for Bocheng," Mo Jiaying said.</p><p>Xin Xia had nothing much to say. Wherever Mo Fan went, she would go.</p><p>Not long after, Mo Jiaying came back with a smile and told Mo Fan and Xin Xia, "You wouldn't believe it, but there really is a resettlement community provided by Shanghai for Bocheng. If everything's okay, I'll sign up our names."</p><p>…</p><p>Saying so, they set off immediately. The family of three quickly packed their bags… Actually, there wasn't much to pack anyway, as the house had already been sold.</p><p>To be fair, Mo Jiaying was quite farsighted, almost as if he could predict that something terrible would happen in Bocheng. He had given up on real estate long ago.</p><p>The entire city of Bocheng was now under military control. How Mu He, a major real estate player in Bocheng, must be feeling right now is anyone's guess.</p><p>They took a car to Xiamen Island, the closest place to Bocheng, and then took a high-speed train all the way to Shanghai…</p><p>"By the way, what should we do if demons appear on the high-speed rail line?" Mo Fan couldn't help but think of this while sitting in the high-speed train.</p><p>"He explained, 'The high-speed rail lines all belong to the Boundary and are protected by it.'"</p><p>"By the way, this should be my first time traveling far from home," Mo Fan said, rubbing his nose bridge with some embarrassment.</p><p>"He Mo Fan seems like he came through a portal; he doesn't even know basic knowledge," Xinxia whispered with a sneaky smile.</p><p>"That's right. I come from a world of science. Their schools don't teach this boring and dull magic but rather fascinating scientific theories. They explain all phenomena scientifically, unlike here where magic is considered superstition, isn't it!" Mo Fan said righteously.</p><p>Xinxia had probably not seen anyone so seriously babble on for a long time; she was taken aback by what he said.</p><p>"What are you talking about? It's those unambitious students always daydreaming of scientific things without magic. Without the exploration of these great figures in magic, would there be your home appliances, computers, and means of transportation today? Forget about riding high-speed trains powered by Lightning Drive Diagrams! They don't even respect history or their predecessors at all!" an elderly man with black hair and a black beard sitting next to Mo Fan said.</p><p>After hearing this, Mo Fan was utterly flustered.</p><p>Well, Mo Fan thought he had adapted to these changes over the past three years. However, when the old man mentioned that high-speed trains were powered by Lightning Drive Diagrams, he felt his intelligence might not be up to par.</p><p>"Sir, my son just likes to say strange things; don't take it to heart. Are you going to Shanghai too, sir?" Mo Jiaxing was a friendly person and immediately started chatting with the old man.</p><p>"Yes, I attended a seminar in Xiamen and am now returning to Shanghai."</p><p>"Hearing your tone of voice, could you be an elderly professor?" Mo Jiaxing asked further.</p><p>The old man stroked his beard, a hint of smile appearing at the corners of his eyes. "Professor of History at Ming Zhu University."</p><p>Mo Jiaxing's face immediately showed signs of respect upon hearing this.</p><p>Mo Fan also looked at the black-bearded old man in surprise.</p><p>There were no prestigious universities like Tsinghua or Fudan in Shanghai in his previous world, but rather Ming Zhu University dominated the scene. It could be said to be every magician's dream university.</p><p>If not for the disaster in Bocheng, Mo Fan would have taken the entrance exam for Ming Zhu University. Now that the entire city of Bocheng was dealing with a huge resettlement effort, most candidates were arranged to study at other government-funded institutions for another year before taking the magic college entrance exams the following year.</p><p>"He explained, 'The high-speed rail lines all belong to the Boundary and are protected by it.'"</p><p>"By the way, this should be my first time traveling far from home," Mo Fan said, rubbing his nose bridge with some embarrassment.</p><p>"He Mo Fan seems like he came through a portal; he doesn't even know basic knowledge," Xinxia whispered with a sneaky smile.</p><p>"That's right.

Now that the entire city of Bocheng was dealing with a huge resettlement effort, most candidates were arranged to study at other government-funded institutions for another year before taking the magic college entrance exams the following year.</p><p>For Mo Fan, who has already reached the intermediate level of mage, attending a magic high school is no longer useful. Now, he needs to enter a magic university.</p><p>The second awakening stone is quite expensive, and such items are usually controlled by schools, magic associations, the military, and noble families. One might not even be able to purchase one on the black market.</p><p>Upon reaching the intermediate level, Mo Fan can cast intermediate-level lightning and fire spells and will also gain another opportunity for awakening.</p><p>Therefore, after arriving in Magic City Shanghai, Mo Fan's top priority is to choose an organization that can facilitate his second awakening. The most suitable option would be to join the magic association; given his current abilities, joining the association should not be a problem... but attending a magic university could also be a good choice.</p><p>Magic schools are dedicated to cultivating talented individuals, and resources are distributed accordingly.</p><p>At that time, he will need to find out if Ming Zhu Academy has any special admissions programs for students like himself who excel at... uh, lightning spells. He should inquire from the old professor of Ming Zhu Academy nearby.</p><p>"Professor, does Ming Zhu Academy have any special admissions?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"Special admissions? Unless one has exceptional performance in a particular field, Ming Zhu Academy generally doesn't consider such options," the old professor said as he scrutinized Mo Fan, who looked ordinary to the extreme. "Do you wish to enter Ming Zhu Academy?"</p><p>"My original plan was to take the entrance exam there."</p><p>"Then simply take the national college entrance examination; don't even think about special admissions. Ming Zhu Academy gathers the most outstanding and promising students from all over the country; standing out among millions of candidates is already extremely exceptional."</p><p>"Do they have it or not?" Mo Fan asked directly.</p><p>"Yes, of course they do, but I don't believe it's something a normal person can accomplish."</p>
