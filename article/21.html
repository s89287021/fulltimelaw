						<p>Student Dormitory</p><p>"Fan, it's time to go; we have the annual assessment. Being late isn't good," Zhang Xiaohou said to Mo Fan.</p><p>"You go first; I'll practice a bit more on controlling," Mo Fan replied.</p><p>"Just cramming at the last minute."</p><p>The others in the dorm didn't wait for Mo Fan and went to the exam venue dressed up properly.</p><p>The exam venue wasn't simply taking a test paper in a classroom, although subjects like Magic Theory were also tested; they weren't heavily weighted. The most important part was this annual practical assessment.</p><p>In simple terms, it was to evaluate all students' cultivation statuses since their awakening and then make significant class divisions.</p><p>The Star Sensory Stone looked something like a black pebble the size of a watermelon and was currently being dragged to the front end of the training field by a stone block.</p><p>This Star Sensory Stone was the most important instrument for students' assessments.</p><p>The annual assessment was very simple, similar to when they awakened at the ceremony. Students only needed to place their palms on this enormous Star Sensory Stone, and examiners could immediately judge their cultivation achievements based on the brightness of the Star Sensory Stone.</p><p>Just like the college entrance examination, students' fates might be decided by this one paper. In this world, there were also hard benchmarks: continue studying for better opportunities or pack up and find another way out.</p><p>"Remember what I told you, the strength of the star dust's radiance indicates the level of magic energy within your star dust. Class Eight students, it's time to prove the results of your efforts this year; let your star dust shine!" Mr. Xue Mushi said with great enthusiasm.</p><p>"Teacher Xue, I'm sorry, but I might be expelled from school," a delicate girl named Li Hua Dai Yu said with tears in her eyes. Her nervous and anxious appearance tugged at the heartstrings of the surrounding students.</p><p>"How can that be? You've been working hard on all fronts; don't be so pessimistic."</p><p>"But I'm so clumsy, no matter how hard I practice every day, the stardust still looks so faint." said the girl named He Yu.</p><p>"He Yu, don't be afraid. Even if you fail, there's me, right? As long as one of us is a mage in the family," said Lu Jianhua, the head of Mo Fan's dormitory, patting He Yu's chest.</p><p>"Just go to the side; you might even get eliminated yourself!"</p><p>"What are you kidding? When my hand touches it, the light will blind your titanium alloy dog eyes!" Lu Jianhua boasted arrogantly.</p><p>Soon enough, the three school officials and examiners finally arrived on the scene.</p><p>The examiners were mostly from the Discipline Office, responsible for enforcing rules; students usually dreaded seeing them.</p><p>The examiners took their positions as 30 new student classes, totaling 1500 people, stood on the training field in awe-inspiring formation, arranged in various blocks.</p><p>Before the test began, it was customary for the principal to address them; this happened every year.</p><p>Then came the board members' speeches.</p><p>When Mu He ascended the podium and enthusiastically painted a rosy future for the mages, Mo Fan couldn't help but chuckle inwardly.</p><p>His speech was filled with high hopes for the younger generation, yet Mo Fan knew better than anyone what kind of person Mu He really was.</p><p>"Today is also a very special day."</p><p>"That's because we have invited our city's most outstanding female mage. She was directly admitted to the Imperial Capital Mage Academy at the age of 15; I believe many of you have heard her legendary story… That's right, it's Mu Ningxue! Let's welcome this magical genius who should be in your year but has already advanced to university!" exclaimed Mu He loudly.</p><p>With these words, the entire field of over a thousand people erupted into excitement.</p><p>"Oh my God, it's Mu Ningxue. I heard when she awakened, her ice elemental power froze the ground beneath her feet solid."</p><p>"That was all rumor. I am the most accurate one, I heard she learned the Ice School basic skill - Ice Vine in just eight months."</p><p>"Eight... eight months?? Good heavens, it took me a whole year at school and I only managed to grasp five starstones! How can people be so different!!"</p><p>"But that's not the point... The point is, she is also a big beauty, truly a paragon of virtue and beauty, the pride of Bo City!"</p><p>At once, all the students in the school started chatting excitedly. From their reactions, it was clear they were all quite familiar with Mu Ningxue.</p><p>None of them expected to see this legendary magic genius during their annual exam today!</p><p>Mo Fan looked up and gazed at the podium. Indeed, he saw a beautiful figure standing there as gracefully as a lotus in snow, a high-waisted tight white dress showcasing her exquisite figure.</p><p>What drew the most attention was not only her body radiating with sexy teenage allure but also her breathtaking snowy silver center-parted long hair...</p><p>Despite the hot weather, this woman standing on the podium appeared like a snow fairy walking down from the Tian Shan ice and snow to the mortal world, so ethereally beautiful and untouchable!</p><p>When everyone saw this woman appear, they were all in stunned silence.</p><p>Having heard many tales of Mu Ningxue's beauty but never seen her true appearance, who would have thought that she truly looked like an Ice Goddess from her teenage years, be it her demeanor, attire, or her naturally flowing snowy silver hair.</p><p>This was Mu Ningxue??</p><p>The nobility and arrogance emanating from within her!</p><p>Mo Fan himself was also captivated. This might be the first time he saw Mu Ningxue after that incident, three years ago?</p><p>Back then, they all used to call her Little Princess, and she truly was their princess, living in a castle on the mountain, wearing clothes and accessories beautiful beyond compare to ordinary girls, along with her charming and adorable appearance...</p><p>However, in these past three years, Mo Fan felt he almost couldn't recognize her.</p><p>She has really changed a lot.</p><p>Originally quite cheerful and approachable, she becomes even harder to get close to during this blooming period...</p><p>Is it her demeanor that has changed, or is it the significant difference in status as she ages that makes me feel this way?</p><p>"What's wrong with your head?"</p><p>"Oh, I was just saying it offhand."</p>
