						<p>At the mountain pass, Mu Bai stood before the Shadow Wolf Beast with exuberance. The icy power he controlled transformed into a layer of slow-acting frost that coated the beast's limbs.</p><p>Just as Mu Bai was about to show a relieved expression, he suddenly noticed that the Shadow Wolf Beast's movement had only slowed down slightly and did not affect its approach at all.</p><p>"Doesn't work??" Mu Bai was taken aback.</p><p>His ice tendrils could at least freeze three or four people in place. Mu Bai thought it might give his classmates some time to calm down, but he didn't expect the Shadow Wolf Beast's limb strength to be so formidable. The white ice tendrils did not stop it from moving forward.</p><p>"Creak!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>With a foot on the frost, the Shadow Wolf Beast continued advancing.</p><p>The Shadow Wolf Beast's current target was Mu Bai. Its front limbs were raised high in front of him and came crashing down fiercely!!</p><p>"Boom~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A wave of tremendous force swept up dust and debris, even flinging Mu Bai several meters away.</p><p>Mu Bai had no defensive capabilities at all and fell directly to the ground from this impact, dazed and unable to get back up.</p><p>"Mu Bai!"</p><p>Zhao Kunsan hurried over but found Mu Bai's clothes riddled with holes, his skin battered and torn by the sand and stones!</p><p>He Yiyu, who finally came to her senses after a while, was frightened like an incapacitated infant, crouched there crying uncontrollably.</p><p>Her tears seemed to irritate the Shadow Wolf Beast, which took a haughty stride towards her.</p><p>In the eyes of the dark wolf beast, there was no such thing as pitying or cherishing. Mu Bai was shaken to his blood-soaked body by each shock wave, and no one knew what would happen to the delicate He Yu.</p><p>"Damn it, run quickly!" Zhang Xiahou was frantic with worry.</p><p>Biting his teeth, Zhang Xiahou ran towards He Yu again, trying to pull her out of the dark wolf beast's terrifying gaze.</p><p>"Monkey, don't you care about your life? !" Not far away, Mo Fan couldn't remain calm after witnessing this scene.</p><p>To Mo Fan, Mu Bai's actions just now were really foolish. His individual strength could never match that of these demons, who were several tiers stronger than the mages. Fortunately, this dark wolf beast didn't completely relish in slaughter; otherwise, if its front paw had struck Mu Bai earlier, he would have been torn apart and his life endangered!</p><p>"Fire… Fire Zhi!!"</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Zhou Min nearly bit through her lip as she finally released her fire-based skill!</p><p>The ball of fire flew towards the dark wolf beast. Perhaps due to the extreme panic, this Fire Zhi only landed on the beast's feet, causing a cluster of inexplicable flames to ignite beside it, casting the dark blue dark wolf beast in a bright red glow.</p><p>The dark wolf beast paid no heed to the burning flames and continued moving towards He Yu and Zhang Xiahou.</p><p>"Brute, taste my Thunder Seal!!"</p><p>Xu Shaoting roared, surrounded by countless electric arcs.</p><p>These electric arcs whipped towards the dark wolf beast at Xu Shaoting's command!</p><p>Each purple lightning arc caused a twitch in the dark wolf beast's body. The beast finally couldn't move forward and let out a low, pained growl!</p><p>The dark wolf beast's emerald eyes suddenly swept over to Xu Shaoting.</p><p>"Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!"</p><p>The dark wolf beast opened its maw and roared at Xu Shaoting.</p><p>Suddenly, a fierce gale erupted. The mountain pass was already littered with rocks and sand, which were whipped up by the roaring wind, resembling a surging earth dragon heading towards Xu Zhao ting.</p><p>"Sanpa!" Xu Zhao ting cried out in panic upon seeing this scene.</p><p>Wang Sanpa howled in response.</p><p>"Earthwave! Teleportation!!"</p><p>Surprisingly, Wang Sanpa's bulky frame bent down, his hands plunging into the ground...</p><p>The ground was covered with gravel and pebbles. As soon as Wang Sanpa's hands sank into it, the sand transformed into a controllable wave of earth, akin to ripples spreading out in a mirror-like lake when a stone is thrown in.</p><p>This ripple appeared on the sandy surface, transforming into an earthwave that swiftly approached Xu Zhao ting...</p><p>Xu Zhao ting was originally unable to dodge the flying rocks and sand. However, the emergence of this earthwave allowed him to suddenly move several meters away, evading those deadly projectiles that could have turned his body into a bloody pulp!</p><p>With his eyes closed, Xu Zhao ting opened them after realizing he had moved to another location, his face filled with delight as he gave a thumbs up to his best friend, Wang Sanpa.</p><p>Wang Sanpa chuckled; he hadn't expected his earthwave to be so timely and effective.</p><p>"Don't be afraid, everyone! With so many of us here, if each person casts their magic spells, we can definitely defeat this one-eyed monster wolf!" After displaying his remarkable prowess, Xu Zhao ting immediately adopted a leadership tone and shouted at the group.</p><p>"Quickly link up with Star Tracks! Thunder Seal has a muscle paralyzing effect; this one-eyed monster wolf is now probably unable to move. Take advantage of this opportunity to counterattack!" Wang Sanpa also encouraged everyone, shouting enthusiastically.</p><p>As Wang Sanpa mentioned, the warg beasts were already immobilized and convulsing uncontrollably due to the Thunder Seal's stimulation.</p><p>This was undoubtedly a life-saving piece of news for everyone. Several calm-headed mages quickly attempted to connect with Star Tracks.</p><p>"Radiance! Purification!"</p><p>"Icicle Vines! Frost Delay!"</p><p>"Water Wave? Dissipation!"</p><p>"Earthwave? Shift!"</p><p>"Fire Surge? Burn!"</p><p>In a moment, seven or eight students from different disciplines completed their magic, and these spells produced various effects towards the Shadow Wolf Beast.</p><p>Paralyzed in place, the Shadow Wolf Beast immediately suffered skill attacks from all directions, letting out a painful roar.</p><p>"Heat element! Heat mages, hurry up! We have temporarily suppressed this one-eyed demon wolf. Burn it to death!" Xu Shaoting had already taken the lead, continuing to cast another lightning seal while shouting.</p><p>Zhou Min had bitten her lips until they bled; she finally released an accurate and complete Fire Surge, flames igniting on the Shadow Wolf Beast's spine. It could be seen that the Shadow Wolf Beast clearly cried out in even greater pain.</p><p>"Ahhhh~~~~~~~~~~~Ahhhh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Just when everyone thought their group attack would work, this Shadow Wolf Beast let out two roars consecutively.</p><p>Two whirlwinds of sand and debris simultaneously rose, one sweeping towards Xu Shaoting and Wang Sanpang, the other towards the other three mages who could cast spells.</p><p>These two whirlwinds dealt a devastating blow to these students, causing them to be beaten until their flesh was torn apart...</p><p>The students who had just found a glimmer of hope were completely defeated in an instant!</p>
