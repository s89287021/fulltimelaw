						<p>Mu Zhuoyun, I see that the two young geniuses from Bocai have performed exceptionally well today. Let's end it here. As the leader of Bocai, you can just dismiss your son's boasting with a smile. Principal Zhu finally spoke up.</p><p>All guests present actually knew about Mo Fan and Mu Zhuoyun’s grudge, and they also knew that if Mo Fan lost, he would have to kneel and apologize to Mu Zhuoyun until the latter was satisfied.</p><p>Mo Fan’s performance really amazed everyone; a prodigy who reached level 3 Fire Surge through his own cultivation definitely deserved their admiration.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Ningxue similarly fixed her gaze on Mu Zhuoyun's face. She also hoped that her father would end this matter.</p><p>This duel, if not for Yuang taking the advantage of possessing many magic tools, would have basically been lost to the unexpectedly formidable Mo Fan. Mu Ningxue felt that even a victory wouldn't be glorious.</p><p>"Give up? Impossible!" Mu Zhuoyun snorted coldly.</p><p>To dare come in front of him and point his nose and curse at him, how could he, Mu Zhuoyun, continue living in Bocai? Winning is winning; once he said it, he should fulfill it!</p><p>"At home Xing, what are you laughing about? Do you know that your son will have to kneel and apologize to others?" A gardener sitting sideways spoke.</p><p>"What kneeling??" Mo Jiaxing asked blankly. Mo Jiaxing was happy because he hadn't expected his son to move the hearts of all the important people in the city.</p><p>"Damn, don't you know that there's a bet between Mu Zhuoyun and your son? If Yuang loses, Mu Zhuoyun will personally apologize to both of you for what happened back then. But if your son loses, he'll have to kneel and apologize to Old Master Mu until he’s satisfied! Our children only talked about Mu Zhuoyun behind his back a few times, how many times did yours curse him in front of him? Even a big shot can't be tolerant all the time; today Old Master Mu doesn’t plan on letting Mo Fan off!" The gardener said helplessly.</p><p>Mo Jiaxing had no idea about the bet at all; he was truly an incredibly foolish father.</p><p>Mo Jiaxing also froze. He really didn't know about this!</p><p>How stubborn and arrogant his son was, Mo Jiaxing knew very well. Making him kneel and apologize to others in front of classmates, teachers, neighbors, and Mu Ningxue??</p><p>What were today's children like, jumping off buildings after just one slap; giving someone a knee in such a situation would make one ashamed for life!</p><p>Mo Jiaxing hurriedly stood up and ran towards the central main seat.</p><p>"Old Master Mu, Old Master Mu..." Mo Jiaxing called out to Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>"Oh, Mo Jiaying?" Mu Zhuoyun squinted his eyes. This old driver was someone he still remembered.</p><p>"Considering all these years, please don't make things difficult for a child. Think about it, there are quite a few people here today who are his classmates, teachers, and friends..." Mo Jiaying pleaded desperately.</p><p>"No, no, don't bring up those years. It sounds like I haven't paid you your wages. That time I already showed leniency because of your hard work, but this time, I won't let him off under any circumstances!" Mu Zhuoyun was resolute.</p><p>Mo Jiaying suddenly panicked as he hadn't expected that he would have to kneel and apologize.</p><p>In today's era, especially in his prime years, kneeling and apologizing in front of so many people would be a tremendous blow to one's dignity??</p><p>"Then... then I'll do it on his behalf. As the saying goes, 'If a son doesn't learn, it's the father's fault.' I'll kneel and apologize for him. I'll get up when you're satisfied," Mo Jiaying said anxiously.</p><p>No sooner had he spoken than this old driver kneeled down in front of everyone. Those eyes, already lined with wrinkles, looked up at Mu Zhuoyun sitting there.</p><p>Everyone's attention immediately fell on Mo Jiaying.</p><p>Facing such scrutiny, Mo Jiaying also felt a great sense of humiliation.</p><p>However, upon closer thought, if Mo Fan, who had cultivated magic to the point of overshadowing his peers, were to do this, the humiliation would be multiplied many times over.</p><p>He had already earned the recognition of the important figures in Bocity. He had even nearly defeated Yu Ang, whom the Mu family was grooming as a priority. Over these three years, he must have worked incredibly hard... He was an intelligent child. Would he rashly make such a bet with Mu Zhuoyun if not to help his fatherless self regain the dignity of being chased away like a dog back then?</p><p>This son was far too capable compared to himself and would surely become an outstanding mage in the future. Kneeling today would cast a shadow over his life forever. He was just an old driver, an unremarkable old man, and such an embarrassing thing for life wouldn't affect him.</p><p>Looking at Mu Zhuoyun, Mo Jiaying saw that he clearly wasn't going to let it go easily. Biting the bullet, he finally knelt down.</p><p>In the arena, Mo Fan suddenly saw this scene, his heart pierced with unprecedented agony.</p><p>Those who are high up will always remain so.</p><p>The lowly and despised will be lowly and despised for life.</p><p>Is this society truly equal for everyone?</p><p>If it were really equal, I wouldn’t have been chased away just because I became close friends with Mu Ningxue.</p><p>If it were really equal, we wouldn’t lose our home, which was merely a place to shelter from the wind and rain, reduced to a mere speck of property for someone like Mu He, who is so wealthy!</p><p>If it were truly equal, a fair magical duel witnessed by countless people wouldn’t result in so many magic artifacts piled up like mountains, making it impossible for grassroots individuals like me to overcome!</p><p>In the old days, social classes were clearly marked, allowing everyone to know their place in society. The most terrifying aspect of this era is that while there are still distinctions among the upper and lower echelons, people remain unaware of them until they graduate from school and are suddenly hit by a thunderbolt, unprepared and in pain!</p><p>Those who kneel? Those who sit?</p><p>More often than not, you stand but have no difference from those who kneel!</p><p>"Dad, get up," Mo Fan said, facing the positions of Mo Jiaxing and Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>Mo Jiaxing turned his head but lacked the courage to rise; he was too afraid that Mu Zhuoyun would demand an apology directly from Mo Fan.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun remained seated, indifferent.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at his father, who had made such a huge sacrifice for him once again, and then looked at the stubborn Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>"Dad, don’t give Mu Zhuoyun your reply so soon; the duel isn’t over yet," Mo Fan said to Mo Jiaxing, his eyes filled with coldness and anger!</p><p>"Reply??" Mo Jiaxing had no idea what his son meant.</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun had no clue either about this nonsense.</p><p>Reply?? Am I supposed to kneel and apologize to you guys for Mu Zhuoyun?!</p>
