						<p>Mo Fan returned home, his mind filled with Mu He's words. Those words seemed casual and heartfelt but had already revealed a great deal of disdain for the Mo Xing family and himself.</p><p>Unable to even become an apprentice magician?</p><p>I'll laugh at you, man!</p><p>Mo Fan admitted that he had been very close to Princess Mu Ning for some time, but as a child, he had no idea this would bring disaster upon his impoverished family. From that day on, Mo Fan knew that society still had its hierarchies.</p><p>"Mo Fan, hahaha, your problem is solved. I called an old friend of mine, and it turns out he's become quite powerful; he's now the dean of Tian Lan High School. He said that if you work hard, he can get you into Tian Lan Magic High School and help you awaken the magic lineage meant for you. This opportunity comes only once in a lifetime, so make sure to try your best, okay?" Mo Xing walked in with a waxy yellow face but a big smile on his face, patting Mo Fan's shoulder.</p><p>Seeing his father's delighted expression, Mo Fan would normally be happy and celebrate with him by drinking white wine for a week. But after knowing the truth, he couldn't believe his father's hearty laughter, nor could he bring himself to trust that his respected father had never been respected in this society.</p><p>"Really? That's great, no wonder it's my dad who can get everything done. Haha." Finally, Mo Fan also put on a smile and started slapping shoulders with his father.</p><p>"That's of course! Who do you think your dad is?" Mo Xing felt that the kid had paid him enough flattery and his smile widened even more.</p><p>The two father and son drank a few cups that night. During the drinking, Mo Xing mentioned in a roundabout way, "Mo Fan, just stay on campus. I plan to rent out our house. This will give us some extra income for living expenses."</p><p>Mo Fan actually knew that the house was being sold to Mu He. The dilapidated building wasn't worth much, but the land was highly valued in the city.</p><p>"Okay, rent it out then. Anyway, I don't come home often anyway, except for... " Mo Fan pretended not to know and said.</p><p>"He Xia is with your aunt. To be honest, the two of us men aren't good at taking care of He Xian. She's sensible, so we don't have to worry too much," Mo Xing explained.</p><p>"Alright, make sure you visit me at school more often," Mo Fan said.</p><p>"I will. I'm getting tired; I'll go to bed now. You can start school tomorrow." Mo Xing drank the last drop of white wine and stood up unsteadily.</p><p>Watching his father turn around, seeing that back, Mo Fan suddenly remembered Zhu Ziqing's essay.</p><p>Living on campus, He Xian staying with my aunt—both children are taken care of. Then where would this middle-aged man stay?</p><p>Finally, Mo Fan did not reveal this matter. </p><p>In fact, for Mo Jia Xing, making such a sacrifice was a duty and honor as a father. He wanted his son to know that he could go ahead and study with peace of mind, and any problems he couldn't solve would be taken care of by him.</p><p>Mo Fan also knew that revealing the truth would only make Mo Jia Xing feel sad and humiliated. After all, who doesn't want to be a powerful father who can resolve anything for his son?</p><p>Mo Fan could not reveal the truth; while others might not respect their fathers, he couldn't afford to!</p><p>This small dilapidated house wasn't worth staying in anyway. In three years at most, once Mo Fan became a Magic Grandmaster, everything would be possible.</p><p>In this society, magic was paramount!</p><p>...</p><p>The two-month summer vacation passed by quickly, and Mo Fan felt like he had fallen into a sea of books.</p><p>The Tianlan Magic High School library had every kind of book, and the books on magic were as complex and numerous as those in science, truly embodying the concept of boundless seas of knowledge.</p><p>However, Mo Fan had already gained a lot. At least he was no longer illiterate... oh, magic-illiterate. He had basically mastered everything taught in the nine-year compulsory magic education, much like Zhang Wujie had cultivated the Divine Art of Qiankun Dahan and had an aura similar to that of someone standing on the Bright Light Cauldron.</p><p>Classes resumed on September 1st. For all magic students, this day was of utmost importance because it marked their first step towards becoming a Mage and determined which school of magic they would belong to!</p><p>Awakening referred to unleashing the latent power within one's body.</p><p>"Little brat, good luck! It would be best if you awaken Fire Elemental Magic, as this will give you a significant advantage among other magic students. While other schools are also acceptable, fire magic has the highest combat capability for beginners, oh, and Earth magic is also great... Wind magic works too..." said the library's head manager, an old man.</p><p>Mo Fan acknowledged him with a nod but ignored his endless babble.</p><p>To be honest, Mo Fan had not slept all night. For him, today's awakening was not just a change in fate but an unprecedented attempt. In the original world, magic did not exist, but today he could sincerely hold it in his hands.</p><p>Be careful, Zang is full of energy and vitality!</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan is in Class 8, Grade 1, with the last digit of his student ID being 48!</p><p>There's no way around it; he basically got in through a backdoor.</p><p>The earlier your student ID number, the higher your score on the Magic Entrance Exam, which means that people who usually awaken one of the Elements tend to have faster cultivation speeds because they have a comprehensive understanding of all magic knowledge and find it easy to cultivate.</p><p>Unfortunately, Student No. 1 of Class 8, Grade 1, is Mo Fan's old classmate - Mu Bai.</p><p>Mu Bai is actually from the Mu Clan; he seems to be a branch member living in the manor. The reason he has always looked down on Mo Fan is that, within the Mu Manor, he is considered a young master, while Mo Fan is just the son of a servant and essentially a servant himself.</p><p>Unfortunately, this branch member is not on the same level as Mu Ningxue, who is like a little princess. In the past, Mu Bai had tried various ways to win Mu Ningxue's favor, but she ignored him completely.</p><p>"Classmates, welcome to our school. I'm sure many of you have been eagerly awaiting this exciting moment. Before that, there are a few things I want to share with you."</p><p>On the grand magic field, all 1,500 new students were divided into twenty classes and formed perfect square formations, creating an incredibly impressive sight!</p><p>"Classmates, do you know why we become magicians?"</p><p>"You should never forget, regardless of your position as a magician, that our primary mission is to explore human development and protect humanity. Don't forget that there are countless demons lurking outside the comfort of your cities!"</p><p>The principal spoke for a long time before finally getting to what everyone wanted to hear.</p><p>"Alright, let's begin the awakening process today. I hope you all become shining stars in the future!"</p><p>As soon as the old principal finished speaking, the students on the field couldn't contain their excitement.</p><p>Who wouldn't want to control flames that are full of destructive power? Who wouldn't want to master frost to freeze everything evil? Who wouldn't want to ride the wind and soar through the heavens? Who wouldn't want to manipulate rocks and soil to defend against invaders?</p><p>Among countless stories, videos, and movies, there are too many heroes for them to admire and aspire to become such magicians. Today marks the first step of their journey as wizards, whether it be reveling in the beast territories beyond the city or wielding supreme power over a magical metropolis...</p><p>(Mood is good; I'll add another chapter! Starting a new book means being whimsical!)</p><p>(The full-time wizard will have updates at very stable times~~~noon exactly and 10 PM exactly. Under normal circumstances, two chapters will be delivered, but during whimsical moments, three chapters might come. Of course, updates will increase further down the line~~~everyone's support is greatly appreciated! Don't forget to vote for recommendation tickets!!)</p>
