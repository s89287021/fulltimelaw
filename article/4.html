						<p>Awakening is carried out simultaneously in twenty classes.</p><p>Mo Fan is number 48; he will be the last one to receive the awakening blessing in his class.</p><p>The homeroom teacher, who is also their magic instructor—Xue Mushi—has already stood at the very front of the class. The awakening ceremony will take place before everyone, and what the students need to do when called upon is walk forward, place both hands on the awakening stone in front of the magic instructor, and quietly sense it.</p><p>"I say, since you snuck your way in, won't you fail to awaken? I heard that some really incompetent people end up failing the awakening process. Given your trashiness, maybe you shouldn’t waste the energy of this expensive awakening stone," another student from the line behind Mo Fan, Zhao Kunsan, said.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan is a lackey of Mu Bai. Mu Bai himself feels it would be beneath him to confront Mo Fan directly, so he usually sends Zhao Kunsan to do it.</p><p>The situation Zhao Kunsan mentioned about awakening failure does exist; in fact, Mo Fan is quite worried about it too. Technically speaking, he… well, let’s say he traveled from another world. If his physical constitution differs from the people here, this could be a huge joke!</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan, don’t mind this prick. Wait until someone with Fire Magic awakens; show him what it means to look down on others!" Zhang Hou, who is in the same class as Mo Fan and is called Ní Mónkey, said.</p><p>Mo Fan didn't say anything. In the past, he would have used his unmatched ability to curse Zhao Kunsan to death, but today he wasn’t in the mood for it. Partly because he was extremely nervous, and partly because he noticed that the black pendant around his neck kept emitting strange vibrations.</p><p>This black pendant is a relic of the old janitor of the junior high school entrance, Old Ying. Mo Fan suspects that this item might be responsible for the world's drastic changes. That day, Mo Fan slept in the school's backyard while wearing this pendant.</p><p>In the morning, the pendant went berserk like it was possessed, vibrating uncontrollably and causing his hands to shake nonstop.</p><p>Damnit, just stop shaking! Can’t you behave properly as a pendant?</p><p>"Mu Bai!" The homeroom teacher Xue Mushi shouted.</p><p>"Oh, he’s Mu Bai. He looks so handsome, and his grades are number one too."</p><p>"Yes, yes, I saw him this morning. He’s really cute. I wonder what kind of magic he will awaken. I hope it’s not a weak type like Water or Light Magic?"</p><p>The moment Mu Bai stepped forward, several girls in the class began to chatter excitedly, attracting the attention of some fans from other classes who kept glancing over.</p><p>Mu Bai put on an indifferent look, but his eyes clearly enjoyed the attention. He walked up to their homeroom teacher, Schu Mu Sheng, with a humble and confident smile.</p><p>"Mu Bai, you are from the renowned Ice Family Mu, right?" Schu Mu Sheng asked with a smile.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Well, if you awaken the Ice lineage, you should excel beyond others, but don't forget to work hard. Talent alone cannot determine everything," said homeroom teacher Schu Mu Sheng.</p><p>Mu Bai nodded his head, secretly thinking to himself: Yes, talent can't determine everything, but without talent and a family background, one will always remain at the bottom of society!</p><p>With permission from their homeroom teacher, Mu Bai slowly placed both hands on the floating Awakening Stone.</p><p>The Awakening Stone resembled a thick star compass with an obvious palm print. Although Mu Bai appeared calm inwardly, he was just as nervous and uneasy as anyone else when placing his hand on the Awakening Stone...</p><p>Given his lineage, the possibility of awakening the Ice lineage was the highest, but there could also be some special circumstances. If he were to awaken to the Water Vapor lineage or the Holy Light lineage, it's likely that the Mu family would no longer pay him much attention, after all, they couldn't waste their resources to find corresponding attributes just for him.</p><p>Right hand in place...</p><p>Suddenly, a starlight glow emanated from the Awakening Stone. These glows formed streaks resembling special blood vessels and crept up Mu Bai's right hand.</p><p>It was everyone's first time witnessing an awakening, and the students all tiptoed to watch Mu Bai.</p><p>Mu Bai stood there motionless, as if struck by enlightenment, slightly tilting his head upwards...</p><p>"Creak, creak, creak~~~~"</p><p>Suddenly, a wisp of frosty aura began swirling around the Awakening Stone.</p><p>The frost grew stronger and gradually froze the edges of the Awakening Stone, forming a small patch of ice!</p><p>"Ice lineage, it really is the Ice lineage!!!"</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted behind him, accompanied by some girls' screams. Mu Bai had already heard the noise and opened his eyes in delight! Indeed, it was an Ice Element, possessing the family's primordial element made him easier to be accepted by the Mu Family, and the day of flying high and achieving success would not be far off. Dealing with Mo Fan, such a small social scum, would be no more difficult than squashing an ant... Ah, no, awakening the Ice Element made him a legitimate disciple of the Mu Clan, so there was no need to associate with this petty fellow.</p><p>Far-sightedness should be high; yes, his far-sightedness should be high. There might still be a chance to cultivate together with Mu Ningxue!</p><p>"Very good, it's a pure Ice Element. I think an Ice Elemental stardust must have appeared in your spirit world by now. Work on cultivating it and making it stronger!" Mr. Xue Musheng's eyes were filled with approval.</p><p>Being able to freeze the awakening stone at the moment of awakening indicated that this Ice Element power exceeded ordinary people, making him a very talented Ice Element disciple. This boy would certainly achieve great things in the future!</p><p>"Next, Qiu Yueying!"</p><p>As soon as Mr. Xue finished speaking, a girl with a touch of spirit walked out.</p><p>"Good, Earth Element. Your stardust started off well; it seems inseparable from your previous efforts!"</p><p>"Next, Xu Qinglin!"</p><p>"It's also an Ice Element."</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan tiptoed to take a look. He noticed that the same Ice Element awakening for Xu Qinglin merely produced a layer of faint frost mist without freezing the awakening stone.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that although they were both Ice Elements, Xu Qinglin lacked far more in terms of talent and cultivation compared to Mu Bai.</p><p>"Next, Lu Xiaobin."</p><p>"Yes, Water Element!"</p><p>"Aaaaah, my God, why am I a Water Element? I should have been a Fire Element!" The student named Lu Xiaobin suddenly screamed, audible within a hundred meters radius.</p><p>"Do not lose heart; it does not matter which magic system you choose to cultivate. As long as you can reach the Intermediate Mage level, you will gain more advantages." Schu Musheng’s eyes held a touch of sympathy, but he spoke in a comforting tone.</p><p>Lu Xiaobin had no other choice but to return to his position in a daze.</p><p>In fact, waking up early was very important. If one chose the Fire system, they would possess certain combat capabilities even as an Initial Mage level, and it could provide significant benefits during their subsequent cultivation.</p><p>For the Water system, the initial skill is Water Control, which has a defensive effect that is not as strong as the Rock system. Without refinement, its effects are not very noticeable, at least not for an Initial Mage.</p>
