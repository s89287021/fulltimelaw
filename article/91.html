						<p>Alerts are divided into several levels, with the first level being orange. Two years ago, Bocheng sounded an orange alert when a flare was seen glowing behind the mountains, at which time there were at least three hundred demons lurking around Anjie! Today, two glaring flares rose ominously, indicating a blue alert. Once an alert is issued, it means that the city is facing potential dangers and crises. The orange alert was quickly cleared by Shanks, but today's red alert signals that there are likely thousands of demons lurking near Anjie! Oh my God, Bocheng hasn't sounded a blue alert in nearly ten years. "Ding ding ding~~~~~~ Ding ding ding~~~~~~~~~~" Just when everyone thought it was a joke, Wan Duanfeng's phone rang from his pocket. The torrential rain pelted the faces of hundreds of bewildered military mages at the station. The only sounds around were the rain and the ringing of General Wan Duanfeng's phone. "Hello." In the midst of drifting rain, Wan Duanfeng took out his phone and held it to his ear. "General Wan... we are under attack by a horde of beasts, the light mages... the light mages are dead and unable to release further radiance," came the voice of Patrol Team Leader Zhou Jin from the other end. Suddenly, Wan Duanfeng's body went cold, causing him to tremble involuntarily with his phone in hand. "May Bocheng weather this calamity. Tell Shanks I'm sorry, and also convey my apologies to Pan Lijun." Zhou Jin's voice on the other end was hoarse and sorrowful, tinged with a hint of reluctance. Wan Duanfeng's face convulsed dramatically, his eyes filled with profound grief and anger. "Ding~~~ Ding ding ding~~~~~~~~~" After saying that, the call was hung up. Throughout the entire conversation, Wan Duanfeng could hear the chaotic roars in the background, which echoed in his ears, causing his heart to race.</p><p>Wan Duandong let go of the phone, looking somewhat dazed as he tightly shut his eyes. The downpour seemed to carry a heavy sense of pain, more like swords piercing into his heart.</p><p>Despite the call being ended, Wan Duandong could vividly imagine Captain Zhou Jin’s agonizing scream in the next moment...</p><p>He is dead, he was surely dead; no one knew better than Wan Duandong that there was no way anyone who made a call under such circumstances would survive!</p><p>"Sound the Blood Red Alert!" Wan Duandong took a deep breath. The sorrow left his eyes, replaced by the indomitable resolve of a seasoned soldier.</p><p>"B-Blood Red Alert??? General Wan, are you kidding us?!" the sentinel mage on duty said with incredulity.</p><p>Under the rain curtain, the mages guarding the sentry post were all stunned. For them, a Level 2 Blue Alert was already quite tumultuous; then there was the Blood Red Realm...</p><p>That was disaster!</p><p>The Blood Red Realm was the most terrifying of disasters. Some people might not see it in their entire lives, and those who experienced it once would be haunted by its shadow for life!</p><p>"What are you standing there for? Do what I say immediately!!!" Wan Duandong almost roared.</p><p>Such fools, such fools; delaying the Blood Red Alert by a minute could mean hundreds of lives lost!!</p><p>"Ughhh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!!"</p><p>"Ughhh ughhh ughhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>"Grrr grrr grrr~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Suddenly, rumbles that sent shivers through one’s heart echoed from behind the mountain range, as if continuous thunder was exploding there, shaking the entire ridge.</p><p>The tremors reached the station, causing the stone gate to sway slightly.</p><p>"Ughhh ughhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>Amidst the dense rain curtain, a hazy figure leaped into view, abruptly appearing at the very top of a towering pine tree's canopy. In the downpour, that solitary and proud creature, despite having the body of a wolf, stood half-bent. Its fierce head bore three eyes that emitted an incredibly vicious red light.</p><p>This demon was also looking down upon this human city’s checkpoint station from afar, as if… as if viewing it like a tiny sheep pen!</p><p>"Th… Th… Three-eyed… Three-eyed Demon Wolf!!!" a young military mage said with trembling voice.</p><p>As soon as he spoke, dark shadows darted out behind the three-eyed demon wolf standing atop the solitary pine. These shadows either dominated those tall trees or scattered around their leader, the three-eyed demon wolf.</p><p>The number of shadows grew and grew, their pairs of red, vicious eyes sparkling like stars in the hazy rain, causing one to shiver all over at just a glance, feeling numbness even on the scalp!!!!!!!!</p><p>"T… This… so many… so many!!!"</p><p>Hordes of one-eyed demon wolves appeared beyond the mountainside. They collectively tilted their heads and roared incessantly into the skyward rain, filling the entire mountain range with their cries.</p><p>"They are calling for help, they are continuing to call for their companions!" a summoning military mage who studied demonic languages said in a daze.</p><p>Oh my God, hundreds of one-eyed demon wolves had already gathered there. Hundreds of one-eyed demon wolves calling for companions simultaneously—how many demons were they going to summon!!!</p><p>At this moment, the military factions guarding the station finally understood why the blood-colored alert was sounded!!! </p><p>Demon invasion!!</p><p>Hordes of demons invading the city!!!</p><p>This was a disaster, an unforeseen disaster.</p><p>A downpour, followed by hundreds and thousands of demons rushing in frenziedly.</p><p>The dark green tide of water covered the mountains, but this tide was formed by countless one-eyed demon wolves.</p><p>They galloped wildly, they roared fiercely, and they made the tiny Snowpeak Mountain Station tremble violently!</p><p>Through the dense eyes that shone even in the pouring rain, a profound hatred and cruelty towards humanity were revealed; they wanted to devour every living soul!!</p><p>Under such terrifying scenes, even the mages seemed insignificant. At this moment, they were being engulfed by demons!</p><p>For all army mages, the sight of hordes of one-eyed demon wolves pouncing on them would be etched in their memory forever... Oh, not truly forever, for many might not survive until tomorrow!</p><p>...</p><p>...</p>
