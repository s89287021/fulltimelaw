						<p>Mo Fan walked around but only gathered some information from various people.</p><p>"Why do two young men's duel have to be such a big show? It turns out it was ultimately about the power struggle in Bocheng.</p><p>This battle wasn't bad for himself, saying that he could become famous with one good performance would not be an exaggeration!</p><p>'Zhao Min, Zhang Xiao Hou, He Yu, Zhang Yinglu, Xu Zhao Ting, Wang San Pang... why are you all here?' Mo Fan suddenly noticed a group of relatively young figures, who turned out to be his classmates.</p><p>'The school gave us some invitations, and Mu Bai also brought us in. How could we possibly miss the chance to see our school's top expert and a descendant of a family duel? ' Xu Zhao Ting said with a slightly sour tone.</p><p>Xu Zhao Ting was originally supposed to have this spot as a lightning spellcaster, but Mo Fan had snatched it away unexpectedly.</p><p>However, after the ordeal incident, Xu Zhao Ting's resentment towards Mo Fan wasn't as strong as before. Everyone's lives were saved by Mo Fan, and they actually hoped that Mo Fan would perform well in this duel to bring some honor to their magic school.</p><p>'Brother Fan, I saw Uncle Mo Xing was also on the invitation list earlier. It was probably Mu He who did it,' Zhang Xiao Hou said.</p><p>'That's a good thing.'</p><p>'Mo Fan, you have to do your best,' Zhao Min said with a pure smile.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded his head.</p><p>Two years ago, Mo Fan never thought that the duel he triggered would turn into a city-wide topic of discussion.</p><p>Well, well. Even if he only experienced this spotlight feeling once in his life, it was far better than spending a lifetime in a dark corner, unacknowledged!</p><p>...</p><p>'Everyone, everyone, I'm so glad you all came to congratulate my son. Time flies so quickly, and there will definitely be a time when we can't even complete a single magic spell. The future of Bocheng must be in the hands of those younger and more outstanding than us. You might think that this grand feast is overly elaborate just for my son's coming-of-age ceremony, but I always believe that blue surpasses blue. I, Mu Zhuoyun, can only do so much for Bocheng, enough to keep this city, which has nurtured countless mages and outstanding talents, in its current state. However, it is entirely possible that in the next ten or twenty years, Bocheng will become even more prosperous under the hands of young people, turning into a flourishing city of mages. So don't you think I should hold such a grand feast to witness this future of Bocheng together? ' Mu Zhuoyun sat in his chair, holding a red wine glass high and beaming at the guests present.</p><p>"Here's to the future of Bocheng, let's raise our glasses!" Yang Zuohé stood up first to pay tribute to Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>"The guests here are qualified to discuss Bocheng, but none can see its future like Master Mu Zhuoyun. I'll drink this toast in one go!"</p><p>All the guests stood up and raised their glasses to drink together.</p><p>Among the full hall of guests, Mo Fan amusingly noticed that Tang Yue, who was also attending the banquet, seemed indifferent to Mu Zhuoyun's words, rolling her eyes throughout her drinking.</p><p>It was unclear what exactly Tang Yue had against Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>After the grand feast with the majestic theme of "Great Bocheng, shining like gold all over Mu Mansion," which was filled with a mix of early-stage mages who could only perform one magic trick they were proficient in, and the few true middle-stage mages, naturally came today's main event—Magic Duel!</p><p>Many people weren't there to hear Mu Zhuoyun's cliché speech; they wanted to know who would be this year's winner of the Sacred Spring.</p><p>In Bocheng, how many mages stuck at the early stage could only use one spell that even the most experienced felt like a cocoon? How many actually managed to advance to the middle-stage mage realm?</p><p>Mysteries like Stardust abounded; some individuals initially displayed exceptional talent but ultimately failed to cross the threshold and remained early-stage mages throughout their lives. Thus, the Sacred Spring, which allowed mages to approach the middle stage with high probability, became a highly coveted holy relic...</p><p>Unfortunately, it was open only to young mages full of potential, with just one winner selected annually, mostly by descendants of noble families.</p><p>Mo Fan didn't know about this sacred treasure in Bocheng before he became a student and had no idea that his rash action once led him to seize this coveted training opportunity, which many people in Bocheng yearned for.</p><p>It seemed to fit the saying: You won't know your potential until you try your best.</p><p>Finally, the Magic Duel arrived. Mo Fan followed Mu Zhuoyun's arrangement and waited inside the duel arena early on.</p><p>The arena was oval-shaped, much larger than the school training ground, nearly the size of a sports field.</p><p>There were tiered seating areas on both sides, capable of accommodating all guests invited to today’s banquet.</p><p>Mo Fan stood right in the center of the arena. In fact, he had been standing there for quite some time.</p><p>"Here's to Bocheng's future, let's raise our glasses!" Yang Zuohé stood up first to pay tribute to Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>"The guests here are qualified to discuss Bocheng, but none can see its future like Master Mu Zhuoyun.

In fact, he had been standing there for quite some time.</p><p>Yu Ang did not appear for a long time, clearly Mu Zhuoyun needed to give him a grand entrance.</p><p>This feeling was not very good.</p><p>...</p><p>"My son, that's right, that's my son." Mo Jiaxing was an absolute optimist. He was happily chatting with Mu's old employees.</p><p>"Not bad, Old Mo, you've turned your luck around," a worker who did garden maintenance said.</p><p>"That's true, just don't get beaten to a pulp. I heard Yu Ang is particularly harsh on his training with his brothers and sisters," a worker responsible for cleaning the entire facility added.</p><p>"Young people fighting, what kind of cruelty can there be?" Mo Jiaxing chuckled.</p><p>To Mo Jiaxing, this was merely an ordinary duel, and he didn't think that a big shot like Mu Zhuoyun would treat it as if dealing with a child. In fact, many knew that Mu Zhuoyun wanted to severely crush the arrogant Mo Fan.</p><p>"Place your bets, place your bets! I bet Mo Fan gets taken down in one move!"</p><p>"I can't believe it, he's the top student at Tianlan Magic High School. How is that possible?"</p><p>"At least I placed my bet. I've heard of Yu Ang's abilities."</p><p>As everyone continued to discuss, Yu Ang finally appeared in a specially tailored outfit.</p><p>The attire seemed to be a mix of leather and high-end silk, shimmering under the lights. With some unique accessories attached, he looked like a prince entering his palace.</p><p>It was clear that considerable effort had gone into his appearance, creating a stark contrast with Mo Fan who had almost wanted to wear sandals.</p><p>After changing into such a sophisticated outfit, Yu Ang's demeanor instantly elevated by several notches. His tall figure and slightly feminine charm naturally captivated some young girls.</p><p>The white dress was adorned with patterns that fused the family crest with ice elemental magic. As expected, Yu Ang made a dazzling entrance, and the confident smile on his lips, characteristic of a nobleman's son, already indicated that he would be the main character today.</p><p>(%!(EXTRA string=It is now the 18th day!! The book has been serialized for a month! It's rare to see me update so promptly. In thirteen more days, anything could happen~~~~~ So now is the best time to vote for recommendations, otherwise you'll have to endure the pain of irregular updates if I later pressure you into voting~~~~ Okay, even I find myself feeling like Teemo.))</p>
