						<p>He carried Ye Xinxia to the wheelchair, and Mo Fan suddenly felt dizzy.</p><p>Ye Xinxia, with her meticulous nature, noticed this and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>"It's nothing, just a bit dizzy..." Mo Fan shook his head.</p><p>To think of it, from when they came out of the Sacred Spring until now, he had hardly rested at all. The numerous injuries on his body had not been treated in time, and mentally, he was exhausted beyond measure.</p><p>He needed to take Xinxia away from here, but with this state, it seemed impossible for him to cast high-consuming mid-level magic anymore, which made Mo Fan worry greatly.</p><p>"Your arm has been bleeding, you've lost too much blood." Ye Xinxia quickly noticed the gruesome wound on Mo Fan's arm.</p><p>The wound was bandaged loosely with some cloth, but it couldn't stop the blood from oozing out.</p><p>"Oh, when dealing with the black beast demon just now..." Mo Fan only realized this now; the wound still throbbed a little.</p><p>"Put it here." Ye Xinxia placed Mo Fan's injured arm on her thighs.</p><p>Through Susu's dress, Mo Fan could feel the smoothness of Ye Xinxia's legs. Her fingers, seemingly touching casually, revealed astonishing elasticity. Any pain or blood loss was forgotten.</p><p>Ye Xinxia's legs were neither plagued by any chronic illness nor had any injuries. When sitting, they looked like those of most young girls. Even wearing a dress, her legs were exquisitely beautiful, akin to works of art. Added to the naturally snow-white and jade-like smoothness of her skin, it was almost mesmerizing.</p><p>Perhaps due to their perfection, God had deprived them of their most important function. There was no strength in these legs; they couldn't even take a few steps before Mo Fan started panting...</p><p>He had been to hospitals many times for check-ups, but the doctors couldn't give an answer. Affording more expensive hospitals was out of the question, so all he could do was postpone it.</p><p>While Mo Fan was secretly enjoying this special treatment, an unusual energy slowly rose from Ye Xinxia's body...</p><p>A holy milk-white color appeared at the tips of Ye Xinxia's delicate fingers. They shimmered with a unique glow like light and flowed smoothly like water. This holy milk-white gradually enveloped Ye Xinxia's small palm...</p><p>Ye Xinxia closed her beautiful eyes, placing her folded palms on Mo Fan's long wound.</p><p>Soon, an itchy sensation spread through Mo Fan as he watched the wound on his arm gradually being filled by these pale white substances. They seemed like lively life spirits, weaving together Mo Fan's damaged muscle tissues, reconnecting broken blood vessels, and replenishing some kind of energy that maintained his bodily functions.</p><p>"This is..." Mo Fan was stunned by what he saw.</p><p>The wound on his arm healed at a visible speed, starting from the elbow crease and slowly moving up to his shoulder.</p><p>That feeling... if one were to compare the wound to a zipper, then this healing process would be like someone slowly pulling up the zipper, and in a short while, even the zipper scar would disappear, revealing complete skin!!</p><p>This was the Healing ability!!!</p><p>The power of the Healing school!!!</p><p>Mo Fan stared at Ye Xin Xia with eyes full of disbelief as she closed her eyes intently, his heart surging with astonishment.</p><p>He had almost forgotten that Xin Xia was a Healer, the only person in all of Bocai whose First Magic Discipline awakened to be Healing!</p><p>Most people's First Magic Disciplines awaken as Elemental Magic, such as Wind, Fire, Water, Ice, Lightning, Light, and Earth. However, there are some exceptions among humans who awaken other types of magic like White Magic, Black Magic, or Dimensional Magic in their First Magic Discipline.</p><p>The Healing school is one of the branches of White Magic, often found only among intermediate mages, with Ye Xin Xia's case of Healing as her First Magic Discipline being extremely rare!</p><p>Under this healing warmth, that dizzy feeling from earlier also disappeared. Clearly, the Healer's skill not only had the effect of repairing wounds but could also replenish lost blood to a certain extent.</p><p>This truly exceeded Mo Fan's expectations... he never thought that his adorable Xin Xia would possess such unparalleled power. If she were within the Safety Barrier, Ye Xin Xia would instantly become extremely sought after, as no medical means could match her ability to heal wounds with a single skill!!</p><p>"Xin Xia, how strong is your healing effect? Could you save someone if they had their throat slit by releasing Healing immediately?" Mo Fan asked excitedly.</p><p>Ye Xin Xia shook her head and said, "If life is lost instantly, Healing would be ineffective."</p><p>"Oh, oh, that's already very good." Mo Fan nodded.</p><p>Any veteran hunter who frequently battled demons knew a fact: what truly killed you might not be the one-hit kill demon but the cumulative injuries on your body.</p><p>Wounds bleed, wounds can become infected, and they can worsen. If wounds are not contained in time, it is as if your life is slowly draining away drop by drop. Most experienced hunters carry provisions and water, but more importantly, they carry medicines when venturing out. Unfortunately, the effects of these medicines are too slow to keep up with the battles the hunter mages face...</p><p>If there were a healing mage in the party, this problem could be perfectly resolved, sometimes even better than defensive spells, drastically reducing mortality rates, especially for long-distance expeditions.</p><p>"Check for any other wounds," Ye Xinxia carefully examined Mo Fan.</p><p>Not long after, Mo Fan was as good as new, with no other scars or marks found on him, not even faint traces of scarring.</p><p>"Haha, I see my Xinxia is so capable. What do you think? If we open an pain-free scar removal cosmetic surgery clinic, how much money could we make..." Mo Fan couldn't help but say.</p><p>Ye Xinxia gave this guy a withering glance.</p><p>Mo Fan also felt somewhat ashamed of himself, given that they were now holy mages.</p><p>...</p><p>After the wounds no longer burdened him, Mo Fan felt comfortable all over.</p><p>If so, he could still cast mid-level spells, and those demons outside would never stand a chance against him!!</p>
