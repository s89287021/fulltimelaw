						<p>The Sacred Spring Chamber was a completely enclosed vault, constructed of dark green and black giant stones. Each black stone was carved with some peculiar magical patterns and incantations.</p><p>Although Mo Fan was an educated person, he could recognize the meanings of some of these symbols, and it seemed likely to be a high-level protective magic.</p><p>So do not look at it as just a vault made of stone; even an earthquake would barely shake this place, truly a well-guarded stronghold.</p><p>Initially, Mo Fan thought that the Sacred Spring would be a large bathhouse where he could take off his clothes, lie down inside, and fully enjoy it. However, after passing through several pillars, Mo Fan was astonished to find that the Sacred Spring was merely a four-sided stone staircase altar.</p><p>The stone staircase altar consisted of four layers; at the bottom, there was a small channel carved out, through which clear sacred spring water flowed slowly and quietly.</p><p>Mo Fan observed for a while but found nothing special. Just as he prepared to sit on the stone staircase altar and start his cultivation as Mu Zhuoyun suggested, suddenly, his little mud loach pendant began emitting strange tremors.</p><p>"Are you getting excited like mad? You look like you could drink it," Mo Fan immediately scolded.</p><p>The little mud loach pendant was now a Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tool. Not only did Mo Fan maintain 14 hours of meditation every day, he also absorbed special energy from the little mud loach to nourish his two stardusts. This is how Mo Fan managed to advance both schools of magic to Level Three in an extremely short time.</p><p>Consider that out of all the people in the school, only a few had advanced to Level Two beginner magic by the end of high school, which was already quite remarkable. Mo Fan was ahead of them by an entire level despite taking on one more subject, clearly demonstrating the power of a Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Tool.</p><p>"Could it be that the little mud loach can absorb the essence of this Sacred Spring??" Mo Fan felt his pendant's longing and began to speculate.</p><p>Stardust magic tools and the Sacred Spring should essentially serve the same purpose: accelerating a mage’s cultivation. The energy contained in the Sacred Spring is much more substantial, even capable of helping a mage advance from beginner to intermediate level.</p><p>"Should I try? If this pendant really can absorb this energy, wouldn’t it mean that I could upgrade it to an even higher quality Stardust Magic Tool??" Mo Fan couldn't help but speculate boldly.</p><p>After all, the school's Stardust Magic Tools had their energy absorbed directly by the little mud loach. If the special essence of the Sacred Spring could also be absorbed, wouldn’t it be equivalent to carrying a Sacred Spring with him??</p><p>The Sacred Spring only opened once a year, providing cultivation time for just seven of the most promising mages in the entire city. People still envied them fiercely like that. What if… what if…</p><p>Damn, I can't do it!</p><p>School Star Dust Artifact was turned into scrap iron by the Little Mud Loach, but it was Teacher Tang Yue who helped settle the matter. </p><p>If I were to suck up the Holy Spring of Earth this time, everyone in Bo City would go mad, and I myself would be burned alive on a stake! </p><p>Sit quietly, sit quietly; don’t think about such outrageous things.</p><p>"Little Mud Loach, don’t be impulsive. I know this thing is a great supplement to you, but if you do that, my father will be trampled by the entire city of Bo, so please don’t cause trouble for me. We’ll stay here in seclusion for seven days, then take the college entrance exam, go to university, save the world from demons, and I’ll hold Mu Ningxue in one arm with Tang Yue cuddling next to me. At worst, I can find you a stepmother…" Mo Fan muttered to himself repeatedly.</p><p>The Little Mud Loach pendant seemed to have understood and stopped playing around, lying obediently on Mo Fan’s chest.</p><p>Mo Fan let out a long sigh.</p><p>Damn it, is this still a pendant or has it become some devil child?</p><p>Sitting down on the leather cushion, even without entering meditation, Mo Fan could sense an energy resembling that nourished by the pendant flowing into his body.</p><p>This special warmth was many times stronger than what Little Mud Loach provided. If the Star Dust Artifacts were to be divided into mundane and spiritual levels, then the cultivation nourishment brought by the Holy Spring of Earth at this moment must be top-tier; it felt like he was about to ascend.</p><p>The lightning-type and fire-type Star Dusts, which were in a slightly sated state, began to move. They seemed like two infants suddenly sucking on milk, greedily gulping it down. Each gulp enlarged their bodies further.</p><p>When they first awakened, the two Star Dusts were truly insignificant, mere specks of dust in the spiritual universe with faint luster that was hard to find sometimes. After three years of cultivation, this patch of Star Dust gradually grew larger, its luster clear and visible, as if it had its own territory filled with mysterious power.</p><p>At present, both patches of Star Dust showed signs of growth, each hourly change equating to a week’s worth of Mo Fan’s arduous practice!</p><p>"This is too amazing; my experience points are soaring like I’m cheating!" Mo Fan was overjoyed.</p><p>Resources, too many resources are held by a few people. If I hadn’t showcased my dual-element capabilities, the Holy Spring of Earth would never have been mine.</p><p>With the nourishment provided by Little Mud Loach’s spiritual-level Star Dust Artifact and the effect of the Holy Spring of Earth, there was a high chance that he could reach the intermediate level of magic user in just seven days of practice!</p><p>"Liang Bin, the Guard Commander, asked, 'Is it really so miraculous about this Sacred Spring?' Wang Tonglian, a newly arrived guard, blurted out."</p><p>"Our Bocheng has a long history, dating back to the Qin Dynasty and even earlier. This Sacred Spring can be said to have been cherished and preserved until today. Think about it, our entire Bocheng lacks both an economy and talent, and has no development. What else could make us a somewhat famous southern city but for this Sacred Spring's existence? Indeed, without the Sacred Spring, our Bocheng would merely be a town," Guard Commander Liang Bin said as he sat on the ground with a relaxed expression.</p><p>"Tracing back to the Qin Dynasty, that must be over two thousand years of history," Wang Tonglian, who had just taken up his post, exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>"That's right. As long as one is not an irredeemably incompetent mage, practicing for just one hour inside equals three days of practice speed on a regular day," Liang Bin couldn't help but express his yearning.</p><p>"Commander Liang, you are one of the few people from our Bocheng who have entered the Sacred Spring," another guard added.</p><p>Liang Bin nodded; he would never forget those seven days spent there. For someone truly craving immense power, that place was even more enjoyable than being surrounded by beauties for seven days.</p>
