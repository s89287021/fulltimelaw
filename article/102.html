						<p>"Find me?" Mo Fan said with obvious confusion.</p><p>"Oh, you didn't know about this. Here's what happened: the Black Vatican was behind this disaster. They not only summoned the Winged Grey Wolf but also wanted to use the Sacred Earth Spring to draw more Overlord-class demons here to utterly destroy Bo City," Bai Yang said seriously and solemnly to Mo Fan.</p><p>"It turns out it was the Black Vatican, these beasts!" Xue Mushi said indignantly.</p><p>"Deputy Commander Lin Yuxin should have handed over the Sacred Earth Spring to you," Bai Yang continued.</p><p>Mo Fan did not respond; he just looked at Instructor Bai Yang.</p><p>Bai Yang sized up Mo Fan, trying to determine if the important item was still intact. He then added, "Hand over the Sacred Earth Spring to me. I need to return it to Big Leader Zhan Kong immediately. This is too vital an artifact; if it falls into the hands of the Black Vatican, Bo City will be finished."</p><p>Everyone's gaze fell on Mo Fan. Indeed, they had not expected him to still be safeguarding such an important item.</p><p>"Mo Fan, so you were secretly protecting the Sacred Earth Spring. Good thing we met up with Instructor Bai Yang. Hand it over to him, and let's hurry to the safety barrier," Xue Mushi said.</p><p>Bai Yang moved forward excitedly, almost reaching out to snatch the Sacred Earth Spring from Mo Fan's hands. Unfortunately, he did not see where it was.</p><p>Mo Fan looked at Bai Yang intently and spoke: "It’s safe with me too. Let me personally hand it over to Big Leader Zhan Kong. Instructor Bai Yang, lead us quickly."</p><p>Bai Yang clearly froze for a moment before breaking into a wide smile: "You’re right, you’re right..."</p><p>Bai Yang's words were not finished. He paused slightly, and his warm smile seemed to freeze instantly as a streak of malevolence suddenly appeared in his eyes, distorting his entire face!</p><p>"Then go die!" Bai Yang said coldly.</p><p>As soon as he spoke, the previously docile Shadow Wolf Beast took a huge step towards Mo Fan. Its sharp claws were raised high and aimed directly at Mo Fan's face.</p><p>The sudden change shocked everyone into silence!!</p><p>"Mo Fan!!" Zhou Min shouted in alarm, but could only watch helplessly as the Shadow Wolf’s vicious claws seemed ready to take Mo Fan's life.</p><p>"Officer Bai, what are you doing!!" Xue Musheng shouted loudly.</p><p>Bai Yang completely ignored him; his Shadow Wolf Beast showed no mercy at all.</p><p>At this distance and with such an attack, no student could survive.</p><p>*Swoosh!!!!*</p><p>The vicious claws came down, seemingly carrying Bai Yang's own resentment. After all, the previous Shadow Wolf Beast was killed by Mo Fan, so now he finally had a chance to seek revenge for it.</p><p>Of course, revenge was just a side matter; the Holy Spring of Earth was what truly mattered. Once it was handed over to the Red Robed Acolyte, this city of Bore would...</p><p>How... how could this be!</p><p>Bai Yang was already waiting with blood staining his entire body when a solid Bone Scythe Shield suddenly appeared in front of Mo Fan. The Shadow Wolf Beast's claw struck the Bone Scythe Shield but only sent Mo Fan flying along with the shield, without killing him!!</p><p>The Bone Scythe Shield, Bai Yang clearly remembered that it was presented to Mo Fan by Chanchong. But how could this brat possibly have had time to prepare in such close proximity? An attack at this distance wouldn't allow even a magical tool to be released; unless this brat already suspected his identity!</p><p>After withstanding one heavy claw strike, the Bone Scythe Shield shattered into countless light spots and vanished. Mo Fan, who slid back over ten meters, finally stabilized himself.</p><p>Lifting his head, Mo Fan's face was grim, and the rise and fall of his chest indicated his anger.</p><p>Sure enough, Officer Bai had problems.</p><p>"Damn thing!" Mo Fan spat out some saliva and cursed fiercely.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Fan had no time to explain anything to this black church spy.</p><p>He glanced at his other companions still standing there and quickly shouted at them, "Be careful, this guy's summon beast is not..."</p><p>Captain Bai's face darkened immediately, and his pupils flashed with malevolent light. </p><p>In an instant, two black shadows that were slowly crawling along the side railings of the bridge darted out with incredible agility. Their exceptionally slender and sharp forelimbs, like scythes, slashed towards Zhang Xiaohou and He Yushan who were closest to them!!!</p><p>Captain Bai's sudden betrayal came so abruptly that no one had time to react, let alone notice the creatures emerging from both sides of the bridge.</p><p>A monkey-like face, a deformed body, completely black as if covered in some tight leather armor, hideously ugly—this was precisely the Black Cult's emblem, the black beast demon!</p><p>When Mo Fan saw one of the black beast demons lunging at Zhang Xiaohou, his heart pounded fiercely.</p><p>At that moment, he desperately wanted to complete his star track within less than a second and obliterate the beast demon in an instant. However, his magic release speed was far too slow.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou remained rather innocent; he could never have developed suspicion towards Captain Bai like Mo Fan did. Any normal student would never entertain doubts about their instructor.</p><p>Before he could unleash his wind track, when he turned around, he was horrified to see the ugly black monster lunging at him...</p><p>Was this how it ended?</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou couldn't even believe it himself.</p><p>After experiencing such a terrifying three-kilometer death route with Fan Ge, they had finally reached the safety barrier, only to die at the hands of their own instructor.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou closed his eyes.</p><p>"Pu~~~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Scalding blood splashed onto his face. Zhang Xiaohou felt a moment of helplessness flash through his mind.</p><p>Did this beast tear open my chest? It was so fast that I sensed the blood on my face before feeling my chest being ripped apart.</p><p>Another second passed, and Zhang Xiaohou still didn't feel any pain. He opened his eyes in puzzlement and confusion.</p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, he was shocked to find that the monstrous beast attacking him had been flung away by some unknown force and was now crashing heavily beside a motorcycle.</p><p>Was he not dead??</p><p>Then what about all this blood…</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou abruptly turned his head but froze on the spot.</p><p>It was a pale face, so pitiful that one couldn’t help wanting to embrace her.</p><p>Blood spurted from her body, scalding hot, burning Zhang Xiaohou’s entire being.</p>
