						<p>"Have any discoveries been made?" Guo Cai Tang asked.</p><p>"I asked the last person who saw the missing girl, and she said she smelled a foul odor in the cafeteria. It's basically certain that there's either a psycho kidnapper or a demon in there," Mo Fan pushed up his glasses, which reflected a gleam of wisdom. He remembered Conan's words: Ah, right, there is only one truth!</p><p>"Is that so? Then you'll guard the cafeteria tonight while we check the teaching building, Mingwen Park Hill, dormitory building, and playground," Guo Cai Tang said with an air of superiority.</p><p>"Well... why can't I guard the dormitory building? I heard there are still quite a few boarders here. Their safety should be left to..."</p><p>"Fat Stone will do just fine there."</p><p>Mo Fan felt his head throb. Fat Stone was clearly one of those creepy uncles who would steal girls' underwear; having him guard the girl's dormitory would only make things more dangerous!</p><p>...</p><p>That night, Mo Fan was indeed assigned to guard the cafeteria.</p><p>The Mingwen Girls' High School cafeteria was enormous, like a grand hall. As a private school, it was reasonable that their cafeteria was spacious and luxurious, unlike the cafeteria at Tianlan Magic High School, where even if someone tried to hide something there, the cafeteria lady would just sweep them out with her broom.</p><p>The dark cafeteria was illuminated by some distant lights, leaving only a few spots lit up. The neatly arranged tables and chairs stood empty. Mo Fan, squatting in a corner, imagined summer's girls wearing short skirts having meals here, the air filled with fragrance, endless spring...</p><p>"Clang!!"</p><p>"Clang!!!"</p><p>"Clang Clang Clang!!!!"</p><p>Suddenly, a sound came from somewhere.</p><p>A forgotten iron spoon, swinging along with the table and chairs, slowly moved toward the corner of the table.</p><p>The spoon fell and hit Mo Fan's head. He was quick to grab the small iron spoon before it could reveal his position.</p><p>Damn, that ice cream I ate out of boredom in the evening almost exposed my location. "This cafeteria is truly peculiar. What exactly is causing this tremor? It feels like there’s a construction crew down below. Could it be that someone is building an underground dungeon? Lately, the demon fad has been all over the place," Mo Fan stealthily peeked around, observing his surroundings.</p><p>"Gurgle~~~ gurgle gurgle~~~~~~~~"</p><p>Suddenly, a very strange low growl emanated from the kitchen area of the cafeteria.</p><p>Accompanying this sound, Mo Fan immediately detected an odor of rotten food—a mix of leeks, fishy meat, and pickled vegetables.</p><p>"Damn, are there really demons??" Mo Fan’s heart tightened.</p><p>Before joining the city demon-hunting team, Mo Fan had always believed that cities were tranquil and peaceful places where demons were mere stories adults told to scare children who wouldn’t sleep. He never imagined that demons could actually lurk within the city. It seemed that what his aunt Mo Qing said back then was not entirely false!</p><p>Thinking about it, a city is vast with countless unknown corners. If a demon appeared and caused harm, the police would suppress it and resolve the issue discreetly. The panic among the crowd caused by such an incident would be far greater than the incident itself.</p><p>Mo Fan pulled out his communicator, secretly pressing it down in his pocket.</p><p>This communicator was simple; it sent signals and provided location information to his teammates, letting them know that he was in trouble!</p><p>"Gurgle gurgle!!! Gurgle gurgle!!!!!!!"</p><p>As soon as Mo Fan pressed the communicator, whatever was in the cafeteria kitchen seemed to sense the signal’s fluctuations. A sinister blue eye eerily peered out from behind the frosted glass window, directly locking onto Mo Fan who had triggered the signal.</p><p>The pupil was as large as a basketball, and the warts covering the eye moved in such a manner that it gave Mo Fan goosebumps.</p><p>By the reflected light, Mo Fan could make out an outline…</p><p>It was a neck.</p><p>A neck as thick as one person’s embrace around a tree. The neck and head were indistinguishable; there was only a basketball-sized eye and a mouth filled with rotten food in what seemed to be the head area!!</p><p>"Grass Mud Horse, do these demons come with built-in wireless receivers? I send a signal and they can detect it!" Mo Fan cursed in his heart.</p><p>The moment he pressed the button, this neck-giant-eyed monster locked onto him. The extraterrestrial beings depicted in American Hollywood blockbusters didn’t have such incredible capabilities, did they?</p><p>"Gurgle!!"</p><p>Suddenly, the monster’s basketball-sized pupils seemed to be concentrating on something, and one could see its pupils intensely contracting!</p><p>The energy reached a critical point, and a moment later, a bloody red beam shot out from the creature's eyes!</p><p>The bloody red ray first pierced through the glass window separating Student Tian Shui Yi Fang from the cafeteria worker, then flew straight through a row of cafeteria tables, heading directly towards Mo Fan’s location!!</p><p>Mo Fan nearly wet his pants.</p><p>This thing attacked him without warning, its cold gaze reminiscent of the cafeteria worker’s wrathful look when he hoped she would serve more meat but instead met with annihilation.</p><p>Fortunately, Mo Fan was no stranger to dealing with demons. He quickly performed a side roll towards the cafeteria entrance upon seeing the attack!</p><p>In the next second, a black hole appeared where Mo Fan had been standing just moments ago. If he hadn’t dodged, that hole would have pierced through his chest.</p><p>The power of Stardust could alter a mage’s physical condition to some extent. Although this change wasn’t very noticeable, it did ensure that mages wouldn’t be unable to dodge even obvious attacks.</p><p>Mo Fan was incredibly wise; he had chosen the position closest to the entrance from the beginning. This roll allowed him to escape the cafeteria successfully.</p><p>However, things were not as simple as Mo Fan thought. The neck-giant-eyed monster let out a piercing scream and rushed out from the kitchen. Its enormous eyes were once again concentrating on something red.</p><p>Mo Fan turned back to take a look, and his heart filled with even greater alarm.</p><p>This thing’s attack frequency was so fast; he probably couldn’t dodge this time!</p><p>Mo Fan began using his mind to trigger the magic tool imprint in his soul, intending to summon the Bone Scythe Shield to help him defend himself.</p><p>"Water Control·Dissipation!"</p><p>Just as Mo Fan was about to complete his action, a delicate voice came from the nearby basketball court.</p><p>Immediatly after, Mo Fan saw water materialize in the air before him. This stream of water moved gracefully like a silk ribbon and quickly intertwined into an arched water shield.</p><p>When the crimson piercing light struck this shield formed by the entwined water ribbon, it seemed to be completely disintegrated. The crimson energy instantly dissipated with the Water Control skill, turning into countless droplets that scattered at Mo Fan's feet!</p><p>Mo Fan immediately canceled the summoning of his Bone Scythe Shield, turned his head, and just in time saw a girl named Xiao Ke sweetly smile at him, baring two cute little tiger teeth.</p><p>Xiao Ke?</p><p>Girl, you came so damn timely!!</p>
