						<p>Not long after, a military mage appeared in the old banyan tree district. One of the healers on the team promptly cured Captain Xu Dahan's torn wound. Fortunately, Xu Dahan was a magician whose constitution had been altered by stardust; if he were an ordinary person, he would have surely died. Seeing the large gash from his chest to his abdomen, Mo Fan clearly realized how important defensive skills were and was grateful to have a defensive magic weapon, the Scythe Shield, or else he too would have died. "Mr. Yang, I think we should sound the alarm; demons are appearing in the city more frequently than usual, which is quite abnormal," Guo Caitang said to mid-level mage Yang Zuohé. "Our Magic Association has already been discussing this with the Hunter Alliance, and the government is also considering it. However, we sounded the alarm not long ago, so doing it again so soon might cause panic," Yang Zuohé replied. "Demons like one-eyed magic wolves that shouldn't appear in cities are showing up... I have a bad feeling about this," Guo Caitang said. "Don't worry; we're already investigating and adding more manpower to city security. As for some strange incidents we can't cover, you'll need to handle them, Hunter Squad," Yang Zuohé stated. "We will do our best, but the captain is seriously injured, so our movements..." Guo Caitang began. "I'll have a fire mage take over temporarily until your captain recovers. Speaking of which, when did your Hunter Squad add a new member, and it's even a lightning mage?" Yang Zuohé smiled at Mo Fan. "Recruitment." "Recruitment??" Yang Zuohé was stunned and helplessly replied, "I've never heard of needing to go through a mage recruitment for lightning mages before." Everyone laughed, their eyes involuntarily turning to Mo Fan. In fact, everyone was quite surprised by his performance. When they thought they would all be killed by the advanced one-eyed magic wolf, his Level 2 Lightning Seal played a crucial role. The Hunter Squad was fortunate to have found such a willing lightning mage who was willing to travel with them in the city. It was known that controlling a Level 2 Lightning Seal usually made lightning mages favored by large clans; even within the Hunter Alliance, Magic Association, and government, they could choose their positions at will. You Yang stood there, seeing everyone's attention on the young lightning mage, his lips twitched slightly. Even with the halo of an ice clan and being exceptional among the younger generation, the aura of a lightning mage still made him pale in comparison! "Caitang, to prevent Fan Mo from switching jobs, why don't you offer yourself as collateral? After all, he saved your life, and you haven't figured out how to repay him yet," Fat Shi said mischievously.</p><p>"Roll!" Guo Cai tang's proud face turned a light pink, yet she said fiercely. </p><p>Beside her, Yu Ang's expression darkened further.</p><p>...</p><p>The one-eyed wolf demon storm finally calmed down.</p><p>Changing his clothes, Mo Fan returned to the school dormitory. Just as he was about to climb over the wall, he noticed a small figure hovering at the door.</p><p>"Zhou Min?" Mo Fan was slightly surprised. Why hadn't this girl gone home to sleep yet? What was she doing squatting here?</p><p>"Mo Fan, thank goodness... I thought you..." Zhou Min's eyes moistened upon seeing Mo Fan safe and sound.</p><p>After all, Zhou Min was still a young maiden. Ever since the early days of her training when Mo Fan risked his life to save everyone, she had been deeply moved. However, due to her own pride as a young girl, she didn't know how to express her gratitude. This time, because of her grandmother's matter, Mo Fan nearly lost his life again, only for him to rescue her and her grandmother once more. She didn't know how to repay such kindness.</p><p>Seeing Zhou Min cry and sob, Mo Fan felt extremely awkward.</p><p>"In any case, thank you for saving my grandmother. My parents have always been busy, and my grandmother raised me since I was young..." Zhou Min continued.</p><p>After consoling her for a while, Mo Fan finally persuaded Zhou Min back to the girls' dormitory.</p><p>Late at night, when a boy escorted a girl back to her dormitory, and she was still sobbing, it always sparked endless speculation among those well-fed students.</p><p>Upon returning to the dormitory, his roommates started discussing whether they were happy or unhappy about the situation. It was so boring! He had gone out to save the world, okay!</p><p>After everyone fell asleep, Mo Fan sneaked up to the roof of the teaching building's dam.</p><p>This place was Mo Fan's own sanctuary for cultivation, and it was unlikely that anyone would disturb him here.</p><p>"Why is Xiao Niudou not reacting at all after consuming a spirit essence? It looks like she fell sound asleep??" Mo Fan sat on the dam, muttering to himself.</p><p>Just as the words were said, Little Mudskipper Pendant woke up just like a newborn baby, trembling lightly while emitting a glow within an area of only an inch in diameter.</p><p>These glows seemed incredibly viscous, feeling like silk wrapping around the pitch-black pendant.</p><p>Metamorphosis from cocoon to butterfly??</p><p>Seeing this change in Little Mudskipper Pendant, Mo Fan couldn't help but think of this phrase.</p><p>In fact, under the glow's embrace, Little Mudskipper Pendant was indeed undergoing a transformation. Its weathered surface showed clear signs of metamorphosis, no longer as rusty and instead exhibiting a luster reminiscent of jade.</p><p>"What Old Ying left for me is truly a treasure!" Mo Fan watched in awe.</p><p>He could clearly feel the changes in the mudskipper pendant. Once it had completely transformed, a continuously soothing energy emanated from its chest area.</p><p>When nurturing with Mortal-grade Stardust Magic Treasure, one was immersed in hot springs, relaxing both body and mind with the comfortable heat and gentle flow. The sensation of quickly relieving fatigue was very noticeable.</p><p>After the mudskipper pendant's transformation, Mo Fan felt even more distinctly wrapped in something special; if he had to compare it to anything, it would be soft silk...</p><p>This soft silk did not restrain his movements or body in any way. It clung tightly to him, allowing Mo Fan, who had just undergone a great battle, to feel much fresher and more comfortable, akin to an infant lying on a warm crib, basking in tranquility and peace.</p><p>Mo Fan was overjoyed.</p><p>Although he had never encountered Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Treasure before, he could clearly sense that the effect of nurturing vitality must belong to Spirit-grade Stardust Magic Treasure. Moreover... apart from rapidly eliminating his fatigue, Mo Fan felt his stardust being nurtured as well, a sensation akin to meditating.</p><p>"Is it possible to increase one's cultivation without meditating??" Mo Fan became completely energized!</p>
