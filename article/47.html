						<p>"Wha... it's completely another level." Wang Sanpan, half covered in blood, crawled up from the ground. Xu Shaoting was already lying there, his condition similar to Mu Bai. On the other side, five more students had fallen, buried under the dust and debris, with no strength left to get back up. The shadow wolf beast, although injured, was not incapacitated. This shadow wolf beast's power far exceeded their imagination; even when calm and united in groups of ten or more, they could not handle it. "If we could have combined our efforts at the beginning and released a joint attack, we would have taken it down. Damn it, damn it, I can't believe I'm going to die here," Wang Sanpan cursed. "Mofan, you... your fire spells are stronger than mine, act quickly!" Zhou Min shouted from beside him. The only ones capable of harming the shadow wolf beast were Huizi and Lei Yin. However, there were too few students proficient in fire magic. "It's no use, this isn't a Monoculus Wolf!" Mofan stared at this unusual demon. Monoculus Wolves have one eye, but this demon had green eyes. Almost everyone was frightened to the point of losing their minds; who would pay attention to such terrifying features? "He... he... help..." He Yu squatted there, his face as pale as could be. Clearly, the shadow wolf beast despised crying and wailing. After defeating the students capable of casting spells, its target once again locked onto He Yu! "Hurry up and run!!" Mofan became frustrated. This woman was hopelessly foolish; while everyone else attacked the shadow wolf beast, she had time to escape, but she didn't even take a step. No, if this continued, they would all be killed by this demon.</p><p>You must get rid of this thing.</p><p>"Monkey, can you run as fast as you can??" Mo Fan suddenly had an idea and hurriedly said to Zhang Xiao Hou who was not far away.</p><p>Zhang Xiao Hou nodded firmly.</p><p>"Good, I will distract the demon, so make sure to drag me into the cave with you. Got it?" Mo Fan said seriously to Zhang Xiao Hou.</p><p>"Kill it!"</p><p>Mo Fan gritted his teeth, using pain to help him stay calm.</p><p>The fire system stardust transformed into a void of cosmic space that surrounded Mo Fan.</p><p>One by one, the fire stars responded to Mo Fan's call and aligned themselves along the magical star orbit!</p><p>Mo Fan connected the stars at an incredibly fast pace. By the time he had connected the sixth star, the most unruly seventh star finally submitted under his forceful command!</p><p>With the star orbit completed, the magic was activated!</p><p>"Fire Surge? Bone Burning!</p><p>As everything was set, Mo Fan's hair danced wildly in the turbulent airflow, and his entire demeanor transformed beneath the intense flames in his palm.</p><p>The blazing fire swept through the air, making a whistling sound as it struck the giant body of the ghost wolf beast with incredible precision.</p><p>At first, there was silence, but then it seemed like a group of frenzied red vines burst out from within the ghost wolf beast's body. The flames were far more intense than those released by Zhou Min's Fire Surge!</p><p>The flames were vivid and ferocious, and the shadow wolf beast raised its head and emitted a howl of unimaginable agony.</p><p>The shadow wolf beast appeared to be in great pain as it ran aimlessly on the ground, rolling around incessantly. Finally, it dove headfirst into the pool of water.</p><p>The Bone-Burning Flame did not dissipate because of the water; the terrifying burning force was likely to incinerate the shadow wolf beast's internal organs into ashes!!</p><p>Zhou Min, Zhang Xiaohou, Wang Sanpang, Zhang Yinglu, and others were stunned by this scene.</p><p>As for those scattered sharp students near the mountain entrance, they looked at Mo Fan in disbelief.</p><p>"Fan... your Fire Breathing..." Zhang Xiaohou looked at Mo Fan in amazement.</p><p>Mo Fan's Fire Breathing was far more powerful than Zhou Min's, and even the flame effects were completely different.</p><p>Zhou Min's Fire Breathing caused scorching, and when the flames touched the shadow wolf beast, they continued to burn on its body. This scorching could at most cause the skin of the shadow wolf beast to peel and flesh to tear, but it could not truly injure the beast's tendons and bones.</p><p>On the other hand, Mo Fan's Fire Breathing seemed to be burning inside the shadow wolf beast's body. Earlier, when everyone reasonably used their skills, they did not seem as effective as this single Fire Breathing of Mo Fan!</p><p>At the stone platform, the summoner named Bai Yang frowned tightly at that moment.</p><p>Summoners and their summoned beasts had a spiritual connection; Bai Yang could sense his shadow wolf beast was experiencing extreme pain. Clearly, the student's Fire Breathing had severely injured it.</p><p>"Fire Breathing? Bone-Burning!"</p><p>At this moment, the Chief Instructor Zhan Kong and Teacher Tang Yue both showed expressions of astonishment!</p><p>Zhan Kong and Tang Yue were both experts in fire spells; how could they not understand the basic skills of the fire spell system?</p><p>Basic Fire Spells - Fire Breathing was divided into three levels.</p><p>The first level of Fire Breathing was known as —— Fire Breathing? Scorching</p><p>Fire Burn? Scorching Flame, is the lowest form of Fire Burn, and its effect is merely to rapidly ignite target objects, causing scalding and burning injuries.</p><p>However, the effect of Fire Burn's second stage is entirely different.</p><p>Fire Burn? Bone Incineration, as implied by its name, is a higher-temperature flame that pierces through an enemy's body after a fireball hits the target, capable of turning bones to ashes!</p><p>The outer flames of Fire Burn? Scorching Flame cannot deal significant damage to Shadow Wolves. On one hand, these students do not know how to target vital areas, and on the other hand, Shadow Wolves' fur naturally has strong resistance.</p><p>Fire Burn? Bone Incineration is completely different; the terrifying inner flames could likely burn a Shadow Wolf's organs dry, making this penetrating fire skill many times more powerful than Scorching Flame!</p><p>"Which student...what is his name?" Zhan Kong came to his senses and finally showed some praise in his eyes.</p><p>To reach the second level of a fire skill, this student is truly outstanding!</p><p>"He is called Mo Fan!" Teacher Tang Yue smiled.</p><p>Sure enough, Mo Fan did not disappoint; within a year, he had already advanced Fire Burn to the Bone Incineration stage.</p><p>In fact, the Fire Burn that Teacher Tang Yue first demonstrated to the students was Fire Burn? Bone Incineration, so the effect of Flame Incineration is much stronger than what the students saw before.</p><p>"This student can be rated as S!" Zhan Kong said with satisfaction.</p><p>The instructor Luo Yunbo and deputy instructor Pan Lijun also nodded; at this age to reach such a level, it would be hard to find anyone in all of Bog City.</p><p>"Damn it!" Suddenly, the summoner named Bai Yang shouted.</p><p>"What's going on?" The chief instructor Zhan Kong asked.</p><p>"After the Shadow Wolf jumped into the pond and got up, it suddenly became frenzied, as if...as if it were somewhat out of control!" Bai Yang said with a pale face.</p><p>"Damn you! Weren't you supposed to tame this beast's wildness?!" Zhan Kong erupted in anger.</p><p>Baioyang's words made Tang Yue, Zhang Jianguo, Chen Weiliang, and others' faces change dramatically.</p><p>Out of control???</p><p>"Hurry up, stop it!"</p><p>"It can't be done, we still need some time to get there."</p><p>"How could it go out of control? How could it go out of control? It's over, it's over, people are going to die!" Director Chen Weiliang from the Student Affairs Office was terrified.</p><p>The wraith wolf beast had always shown mercy before; otherwise, all those students would have died in the cave.</p><p>Now, this wraith wolf beast is somewhat out of control. If it starts killing indiscriminately, not many of these students will survive.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I... I don't know what caused it." The summoner Baioyang said.</p><p>"What's the point of saying that now? Hurry and save those people!" Zhan Kong shouted angrily.</p>
