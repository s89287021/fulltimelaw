						<p>This enormous creature lay atop the highest point of Bocai City, where its silver dome could be seen from any location within the city. This also meant that the entire city could witness this mighty and terrifying behemoth.</p><p>This scene left Mo Fan gasping for air, unable to recover his composure for a long time!</p><p>It was too astonishing; everything was too overwhelming for Mo Fan.</p><p>What were those shadow wolves, one-eyed demon wolves, or blood-patterned giant mole rats compared to the creature perched on top of the silver dome? They seemed as laughable as shrimp soldiers in its presence. At this moment, Mo Fan's perception of demons had been utterly shattered!!</p><p>It was in human territory, but it felt like entering its own domain. Humans were merely food it kept in the city!</p><p>What had happened?</p><p>Was this still the familiar Bocai City he knew?</p><p>Aren't demons supposed to be driven into deep mountains and old forests by humans? Or have human textbooks been deceiving themselves all along? The true ruler of this world wasn't humans, but these demons ravaging Bocai!!</p><p>It was a nightmare, hell on earth, yet every inch of his body trembled with fear.</p><p>"What was it exactly?" Mo Fan finally regained his composites after a long time.</p><p>Not long ago, he had been fifteen floors below that terrifying creature. If not for escaping through a secret passage away from the silver dome, would he still be alive?</p><p>"Wingcang Wolf, a leader-level demon; commanding hundreds of demons was merely a roar... The only person in all of Bocai who could survive its attack was the military commander Shanka," Lin Yuxin said with a stiff tone.</p><p>"L-Leader-level?" Mo Fan exclaimed in shock.</p><p>In his monster hunting team, Mo Fan had learned many things that school textbooks never mentioned: demons were classified into different levels based on their advancement.</p><p>The shadow wolves, giant-eyed mole rats, and one-eyed demon wolves he had encountered before were all the lowest-grade servant-level creatures!</p><p>These servant-level creatures were already butchers in the eyes of non-magicians; they could not be resisted at all!</p><p>"You saw the Blood Patterned Troll Rat in the city hall; it is a War General-level creature. The Winged Azure Wolf is of an even higher rank, a demonic lord leading this blood-colored alert. Apart from the Blood Patterned Troll Rat, there are over a hundred War General-level Three-eyed Magic Wolves leading countless One-eyed Magic Wolves to battle the military department. With limited defensive lines that the military can hold, more than a thousand demons have infiltrated Bocai City. The Hunter Alliance's Deng Kai has already led all the hunter mages to block and eliminate the demons within the city," Lin Yuxin said in a cold voice.</p><p>"But why are so many demons suddenly attacking Bocai City?" Mo Fan still found it hard to accept.</p><p>"It was the Black Vatican; it was done by people from the Black Vatican," Lin Yuxin said.</p><p>Black Vatican???</p><p>This wasn't the first time Mo Fan had heard of this organization!</p><p>"They brewed the Fountain of Irritability, a potion almost indistinguishable from the Earth Saint Spring. The effect of this Fountain of Irritability is entirely different from that of the Earth Saint Spring; it exacerbates the wild nature of demons, making them nearly lose their senses and engage in senseless slaughter. Although we are not yet sure how the Black Vatican managed to attract this wolf species to Bocai City, they sprinkled this Fountain of Irritability into the mist. When the rain came, the Fountain of Irritability became a terrifying catalyst, causing the wolf pack to start frenziedly attacking Bocai City," Lin Yuxin said.</p><p>When Lin Yuxin first discovered this Fountain of Irritability, she didn't realize its implications until all the disasters struck her, making her break out in cold sweat.</p><p>In Lin Yuxin's view, this was a meticulously planned destruction, with someone wanting to use the demonic species to completely cleanse Bocai City!</p><p>Only the Black Vatican would do something that enraged both humans and gods!</p><p>"What now?" Mo Fan asked in a calm voice.</p><p>"The Black Vatican's goal is to utterly destroy Bocai City, turning it into a hell on earth... Although the Winged Azure Wolf is powerful, it cannot transform Bocai City into a bloodbath within one or two days. However, if more demons of the same rank as the Winged Azure Wolf appear, even with reinforcements, our city will suffer massive casualties," Lin Yuxin said coldly.</p><p>Mo Fan fell silent, completely silent.</p><p>Facing this disaster, it felt like he had become one of the refugees, unable to do anything.</p><p>"Mo Fan, you now need to do two things. First, protect the Earth Saint Spring at all costs... I have a feeling that the Black Vatican desperately wants to obtain the Earth Saint Spring," Lin Yuxin said solemnly to Mo Fan.</p><p>"What's the second thing?" Mo Fan asked.</p><p>"The second is to try to survive this disaster as much as possible. My identity is quite sensitive, and those from the Black Vatican will surely believe that I possess the Earth Saint Spring. Therefore, I will deliberately draw their attention, while you need to hide the Earth Saint Spring as best as you can and stay alive as long as possible. Do not let the Black Vatican find it or fall into their hands," Lin Yuxin said.</p><p>At this moment, a million words flashed across Mo Fan’s mind like a barrage of danmakus!</p><p>Why would they hand something so troublesome over to him?</p><p>Lin Yuixin noticed the hesitation in Mo Fan’s heart and a bitter expression crept onto her face, but she said nothing more.</p><p>Lin Yuixin tidied up her blood-stained light pink uniform and mercilessly cut off her messy hair.</p><p>Putting on her hat, Lin Yuixin, with an air of heroism, quickly ran towards the city that had been ravaged by demons, leaving a trail of blood. While running, she said to Mo Fan in emotionless words, "I will draw all the Black Inquisition people away from you. As long as you don’t blindly rush into danger and successfully reach the established safe isolation zone, you won’t be harmed."</p><p>With that said, Lin Yuixin quickly vanished into the drifting rain.</p><p>In her run, Lin Yuixin did not look back at the student.</p><p>She knew not everyone had a heart as noble as heaven and earth, but she believed that everyone would eventually find something they were willing to protect with their lives. Her sister, who depended on her, had already become an early sacrifice in this conspiracy. The only thing left for her to protect now was this holy spring.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Fan stood there in shock, watching Lin Yuixin’s retreating figure and unable to think of what to say.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mo Fan did not have much time to dwell on his thoughts as he suddenly spotted a group of things chasing each other at the back of Tianlan Magic High School from his vantage point on the mountain ridge.</p><p>Their bodies were incredibly robust, easily breaking through the trees with ease.</p><p>They resembled a pack of wolves charging into an unfenced sheepfold, their greed evident in their impatient gallop.</p><p>Oh no, demons had also invaded the school, and in large numbers!!</p>
