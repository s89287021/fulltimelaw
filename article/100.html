						<p>"Very well, just one kilometer left, and we'll be safe," Xue Museng exhaled deeply.</p><p>It was wise to let Mo Fan lead the team; this guy had more experience than he, the teacher. Using the demon powder for deduction, employing feints, and utilizing a quick-strike method with zero casualties, they had navigated through Mingyuan Residential Area, which had far more demons than the main street they had just passed. Surviving unscathed was truly remarkable.</p><p>"The density of demons outside the safety barrier will be even higher; everyone must stay alert," Mo Fan reminded them all.</p><p>Nine people moving together proved quite agile; unlike large formations where even turning a corner required significant effort.</p><p>"It looks like there are other mages fighting over there. Should we join them?" Zhang Xiaohou said from a high vantage point.</p><p>"They have their hands full and won't be able to pay us any mind. Let's keep moving forward," Mo Fan replied.</p><p>Just as Zhang Xiaohou was about to descend, he suddenly saw a massive wolf head slowly emerging from a flat building. The sharp canine bones sticking out from the head were so prominent!</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou's eyes widened, and his breath seemed to stop at that moment.</p><p>Heavens, it was a three-story flat house, but this wolf head was even higher! How enormous must this creature be? Was it just an ordinary demon??</p><p>"Zhang Xiaohou, what are you doing, come down quickly..." Wang Sanpang urged Zhang Xiaohou.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou's entire body tensed up as he slowly moved behind the wall corner, giving everyone a "shh" gesture with eyes filled with sheer terror.</p><p>Just as Wang Sanpang was about to speak, Mo Fan swiftly covered this fat man's mouth.</p><p>Xue Museng seemed to realize something and quickly gestured for everyone to find cover.</p><p>The eight people hurriedly hid behind the wall corner, not daring to breathe, their faces a mix of shock and fear.</p><p>"Huh~~~~~~~~"</p><p>A puff of breath came out from not far away, instantly creating a chaotic whirlwind on the ground.</p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p>Heavy footsteps echoed, and with each step forward, everyone could feel the buildings shaking noticeably.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou, hiding in the corner of the hallway, was frozen against the wall like a wooden puppet. His height was actually level with that massive wolf's head, and he even felt that the three-eyed monster sniffed towards him!</p><p>Damn it, if it had bitten down, it could have swallowed both this small room and everyone inside, okay?</p><p>Fortunately, the stench of garbage masked the smell of the people present, otherwise, given the creature's size, a swipe with its claw would have resulted in casualties.</p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>His heart started pounding uncontrollably.</p><p>No one knew how far that creature had gone; everyone was still too shaken to move forward.</p><p>"Who…who the hell can tell me what that…that thing is!" Wang Sanpang gazed at the retreating head, his mouth trembling as he asked.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou almost collapsed on the ground, his legs shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>It was too terrifying; how could there be such a monstrous creature in this world, which was far beyond the level of the giant-eyed squirrels and one-eyed demon wolves they had seen before? With that body type, their magic wouldn't even be able to injure others' flesh!</p><p>"It... it's a Warlord-level demon, the Three-Eyed Wolf, also known as the Bone Spike Rabid Wolf. Its three eyes almost have a 270-degree field of vision, and its steel-like sturdy body is covered in sharp bone spikes, making it an nightmare-level demon for us," Xue Museng said with a deep voice.</p><p>"This is something we can't possibly handle," Xu Zhao ting said with a hint of despair.</p><p>"Even mid-level mages would be killed by one hit if they aren't prepared in time. We must leave a message to inform the main force that there's a Warlord-level creature here, otherwise it will cause massive casualties," Xue Museng said.</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>Mo Fan couldn't help but glance at the Silver Trade Building shrouded in mist after the rain.</p><p>If a Warlord-level Bone Spike Rabid Wolf was this terrifying, what about the Leader-level Sky Blue Wolves perched on top of the building's dome?</p><p>How powerful did mages need to be to withstand such demons?</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>The rain had stopped for a while, but mist still enveloped the city.</p><p>A kilometer south of the safety barrier, a female mage in a white uniform was running down the street, her body soaked with sweat. She was being fiercely pursued by two black-skinned monkey-faced monstrosities, as if they were about to tear this slender young woman into pieces at any moment.</p><p>"Wind Spiral! Cyclone!"</p><p>The air pressure suddenly dropped, and objects around started moving and spinning inexplicably!</p><p>The rotation was growing stronger, and soon a massive swirling air current formed into a wind dragon rising towards the sky. The car parked nearby slowly began to lift off the ground, streetlights were uprooted, and the two ugly monkey-faced demons chasing the woman screamed in agony before being mercilessly thrown into the air. The intense high-speed rotation made them sway like blades of grass.</p><p>“Boom~~ Boom~~~~ Boom~~~~~~~~~”</p><p>The car crashed heavily, metal fragments scattered everywhere. By the time those two monstrous creatures reached the air, they had already turned into a mess of bloody shreds, with crimson rain and ooze falling down, their deaths gruesome.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Lin Yuxin’s face broke into a weary smile, her gaze filled with some excitement as she stared at the male mage who had arrived in time.</p><p>"Mr. Yang, thank you!" Lin Yuxin said emotionally.</p><p>"If I’m not mistaken, those are the black beasts that the Black Church likes to summon," Yang Zuohé said gravely.</p><p>"That’s right; this disaster was their doing," Lin Yuxin stated confidently.</p><p>"We had guessed as much, but unfortunately, we had no defense and this Porcelain City… sigh." Yang Zuohé looked sorrowful. The blood-colored alarm had really been unexpected, and he didn’t know how many lives had been lost.</p><p>"I was attacked while guarding the Sacred Spring; their target seemed to be the Sacred Spring," Lin Yuxin said.</p><p>"We are aware of that; they specially sent me to meet you to ensure the safety of the Sacred Spring. So, what about the Sacred Spring? Did you give it to them?" Yang Zuohé asked.</p><p>Lin Yuxin shook her head and said, "They had surrounded me, but upon discovering that I didn’t have the Sacred Spring, they flew into a rage and tried to kill me. I escaped with the help of a pack of rampaging one-eyed wolf demons."</p><p>"You are quite smart, so what about the Sacred Spring?" Yang Zuohé continued to ask.</p><p>"I handed it over to the student cultivating at the Sacred Spring. I thought it would be safer on him than on me," Lin Yuxin said.</p><p>"Are you talking about Mo Fan, that naturally dual-talented brat?" Yang Zuohé asked in surprise.</p>
