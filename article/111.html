						<p>Beside the square, a streak of purple light suddenly flashed, followed by a large field of lightning marks writhing and wildly striking at a one-eyed demon wolf covered in fresh blood.</p><p>The demon wolf's body was scorched black by the lightning, its eyes filled with anger.</p><p>It could not move at all; it tried to tear open the tiny human before it, but failed.</p><p>Finally, the one-eyed demon wolf fell unwillingly after several magic bombardments. Throughout, it never got a chance to touch that human mage.</p><p>"Thank goodness I discovered it first and gained the upper hand," Mo Fan said as he looked at the dead one-eyed demon wolf and sighed deeply.</p><p>This was probably his first time facing a demon alone. Without lightning skills, it would have been easily torn into pieces by the agile one-eyed demon wolf. Mo Fan had managed to take advantage of the lightning strike to gain the upper hand, then alternated with Fire Splash for its powerful explosive effects, barely managing to eliminate that unprepared one-eyed demon wolf.</p><p>After passing through this alley, the shopping square was right ahead.</p><p>Mo Fan searched for a safer route to approach the mall.</p><p>...</p><p>Beside the shopping square, at the rooftop of a ten-story building.</p><p>On the rooftop, two men dressed in black were standing there. They seemed as if they would not be detected by demons, patrolling this area.</p><p>"There was purple light appearing over there earlier; it must have been a lightning mage... Yes, he appeared, looks like he is heading to the shopping square," said one man with a hawk-like nose.</p><p>"It's him!" The other man, whose face was covered, suddenly had a flash of hatred in his eyes.</p><p>"Do you know him?" asked the man with the hawk-like nose.</p><p>"I definitely know him. You stay here and guard, I will go kill him!" said the man with the covered face.</p><p>"Don't take too long; we still have a mission to complete."</p><p>I know, but I will kill this man no matter what!</p><p>Saying that, the masked man gave an order, and soon several black beast demons quickly followed him to the side and sped towards the square.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, Mo Fan had already reached the staircase of the shopping mall.</p><p>His luck was quite good. Although there were a few giant-eyed squirrels wandering around in the large shopping plaza, none of them noticed Mo Fan's whereabouts, allowing him to successfully reach the entrance of the shopping mall.</p><p>Just as the special potion resembling dandelion seeds dispersed, it slowly drifted towards a discovery on his right, clearly signaling to Mo Fan that a creature was rapidly approaching from that direction.</p><p>"Slash!!!!!!"</p><p>Suddenly, a black shadow darted towards Mo Fan at high speed, its sharp claws reaching out through the glass door and pouncing fiercely at him.</p><p>Mo Fan instinctively dodged behind the glass door, avoiding the icy cold blow.</p><p>The black shadow continued to attack, but it clearly did not recognize the glass and smashed into the smooth door. Glass shards flew everywhere...</p><p>Mo Fan quickly retreated inside, ducking his head, only to find a deep blood mark on his arm, extending from just below his shoulder to his elbow. Burning pain rushed through him!!</p><p>Damn, what kind of thing is this? It's so fast!!</p><p>Mo Fan quickly ran away. Looking back, he saw the black creature crawling up disoriented among the glass shards.</p><p>Black beast demon!!!</p><p>Mo Fan was shocked to see that guy with the monkey-faced disfigurement, who looked incredibly ugly. Wasn’t he the Black Church’s emblematic creature, the Black Beast Demon?!!</p><p>Could it be that there were people from the Black Church here??</p><p>"You managed to hide pretty well, but unfortunately, you won’t live to see tomorrow’s sun!" A cold voice slowly came from the doorway, where a person in black clothes had appeared without Mo Fan noticing. The man’s entire face was covered by a black cloth.</p><p>"Who are you?" Mo Fan felt like he had heard this voice before, yet he couldn’t recall who that bastard was.</p><p>"You don’t recognize me anymore…… hahahaha, alright, let me show you who I am!" The Black Church man burst into laughter and raised his hand to slowly unravel what was wrapped around his face.</p><p>In a moment, the bandage fell away from the man’s face, revealing a somewhat horrifying visage.</p><p>His left cheek seemed nearly rotten, as if it had been splashed with some strong acid. His eyeball rested in an eye socket devoid of skin, making it even more terrifying.</p><p>As for his right cheek, Mo Fan did recognize it. He couldn’t believe that this man was also a member of the Black Church!!</p><p>"Recognize me??" The Church man slightly tilted his face to show Mo Fan only his intact right side, maintaining an odd smile despite the stiff expression.</p><p>"So it’s you, is this your new mask to scare kids? It looks pretty good," Mo Fan was shocked inwardly but didn’t hold back and shot a cold, mocking remark.</p><p>"Shut up!!!" The Church man’s mismatched face contorted, and he viciously turned his grotesquely ugly cheek towards Mo Fan. His eyes were filled with deep hatred and fury towards Mo Fan, wanting nothing more than to tear him limb from limb alive!</p><p>"You could have been a fine nobleman instead of becoming the Black Church’s lackey," Mo Fan sneered.</p><p>"This face is all thanks to you!" The Church man shouted in anguish.</p><p>"What does it matter to me?" Mo Fan replied.</p><p>"I was supposed to be the one entering the Sacred Spring! I would have become an Executor of the Black Church after handing it over to Lord Salan!! How much did I sacrifice for this plan?? Ten years ago, I served that old bastard Mu Zhuoyun like a dog, following his orders blindly and catering to him like a son. It was all to earn his trust so I could seize the Sacred Spring that day!! But you ruined my ten-year-long infiltration plan, leaving me in this state, this state!!! Do you know how much pain Lord Salan put me through when he submerged my face in ghost acid? Now it’s your turn! Not just your face, I’ll have you soak in ghost acid all over and turn you into a Black Beast Demon like a slave!!" The Black Church man screamed hysterically at Mo Fan.</p>
