						<p>The strong-willed girl Zhou Min, who was also a fire user, looked at the overflowing radiance and her whole little face was filled with disbelief. This student, whom she had always despised for being unmotivated, actually... actually surpassed Mu Bai? Had she been misjudging all along? All the shock, disbelief, joy, and astonishment were nothing compared to the expression on Mu Bai's face, which looked as if it had been carved by a thousand knives. This expression was beyond words; it was just a mass of twisted, convulsing flesh trembling there. What in this world could be more earth-shattering than seeing one's most despised person make such a dramatic comeback? The sycophantic Zhao Kun rubbed his eyes countless times but still saw the overflowing radiance. The previous arrogant and haughty demeanor towards Mo Fan had completely vanished, turning him into a ridiculous fool, standing out in the crowd! "S!" "S!" "S!" Final result: "S!" The highest level of test at school was S, yet everyone knew that Mo Fan's Stardust Magic Energy was probably higher than Mu Bai's. "Mo Fan, do you want to continue the test?" "Of course!" Mo Fan smiled slightly. Hadn't he been waiting for this day too? Damn it, if not for the world changing, by the time he re-entered high school, things should have been going at this pace. At least the final result was good!</p><p>Release, Mo Fan naturally had to take the test.</p><p>Meditating on magic was not just for shining like Xiao Jinre in front of others, dazzling and captivating them?</p><p>"Fire Surge!"</p><p>The entire process was incredibly smooth. After reciting it, Mo Fan felt solemn and confident.</p><p>Fanatical energy spread wildly from the center of Mo Fan, hitting hundreds of faces, with a searing sensation that was unmistakable.</p><p>The Fire Star Trajectory rapidly formed around Mo Fan after he arranged the stars...</p><p>Blinding red, heart-stirring heat!</p><p>A cluster of flames erupted on Mo Fan's half-clenched palm, like an impatient beast.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the fireball drew a dazzling red trail across the examination hall and accurately pierced through the humanoid puppet.</p><p>"Get up!"</p><p>Raising his hand high again, after about a second of silence, flames suddenly raged on the puppet's body.</p><p>Red, growing stronger by the moment, the raging fire engulfed the entire humanoid puppet in seconds.</p><p>The light reflected on Mo Fan's face, which was smiling confidently and exultantly.</p><p>This was Fire Surge, mastering the power of fire, indescribably invigorating!</p><p>...</p><p>After completing all that, Mo Fan turned around.</p><p>One by one, they stood there like wooden chickens.</p><p>The teachers, students, and leaders were still reeling from Mo Fan's S-level test score but immediately saw him flawlessly release Fire Infusion without any hesitation or discord. In fact, he completed it even faster than Mu Bai!</p><p>Fire spells are more volatile at the beginner level compared to Ice spells, so everyone's reaction to Mo Fan's Fire Infusion was ten times stronger than Mu Bai's Ice Vine. It wasn't just Mo Fan's spectacular turnaround; the imposing aura of the fire magic also played a role.</p><p>"Grade it," Mo Fan glanced at the dumbfounded examiners and said with effortless grace.</p><p>"a!"</p><p>"b!"</p><p>"a!"</p><p>The release scores were announced instantly.</p><p>Sure enough, Mo Fan's score was higher than Mu Bai's.</p><p>Mu Bai was so enraged that he suffered from a heart attack. He really did die this time!</p><p>How could this be? This didn't match the script!!</p><p>His performance in both categories surpassed Mu Bai's!</p><p>"Is this really the Mo Fan we know??"</p><p>"The ultimate comeback in history, turning into a genius in one second and blinding my eyes!!" Xu Qinglin said.</p><p>Scholar Mu Bai's class teacher, Xue Mussheng, had a wide grin on his face. He didn't care about the grudge between Mu Bai and Mo Fan; what mattered was that he now had an S-grade student in his class, with the highest Release Points, likely to be the top-ranked student in the entire school. Climbing from last place to first was something astonishing, like a dream come true. Besides them, Mu Bai should easily secure second place. With both first and second places in his class, Xue Mussheng felt he was on track for a raise and a promotion. "Truly, the Mu family is unmatched! Brother Zhuoyun Mu, you have truly opened our eyes with your talents. If I remember correctly, this Mo Fan student is merely the son of your estate's chauffeur. Yet in a great family like yours, even indirectly, such exceptional talent can emerge!" Hunter Alliance's Deng Kai said. Mu Zhuoyun looked at Deng Kai, who was both a high-ranking member of the Hunter Alliance and the chairman of Tianlan Magic High School, one of the most powerful and skilled among all chairmen. Deng Kai’s praise moved the other chairmen deeply. There was no denying it; even a chauffeur's son proved so capable, on par with their carefully nurtured magic prodigies! Mu Zhuoyun slowly came back to his senses from his surprise. He hadn't expected Mo Fan to be so talented and now, hearing such praise from those in the know, he felt a glow of pride. In better spirits, Mu Zhuoyun began to contemplate. While his younger generation had Mu Ningxue leading the charge, other direct and collateral relatives needed cultivation to strengthen their clan's power. Fortunately, they lacked a master of fire magic, which was precisely what this young man could provide. Although the boy had done things in the past that had made him incredibly angry, those were youthful indiscretions, long since forgiven. It would be better to reward him and have him serve the Mu family.</p><p>Approaching him certainly wouldn't allow him to get close to Mu Ningxue; he could send him to his eldest son, Mu Jiangming, to cultivate into an outstanding fire elemental retainer. That wouldn't be a bad thing.</p><p>Talent should still be accepted!</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun stroked his beard, and there was a hint of appreciation in his eyes. Seeing that Mo Fan had already come out from the examination hall, he said, "Mo Fan, come over here."</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at Mu Zhuoyun, unsure what this old rogue wanted.</p><p>With some confusion, Mo Fan walked to these young leaders and couldn't help but take a look at Mu Ningxue again.</p><p>Damn it, how has this girl grown so... so disastrous for the nation in just a few years!</p><p>"Cough!" Mu Zhuoyun coughed.</p><p>Mu Ningxue shifted her gaze away.</p><p>Mo Fan also withdrew his gaze.</p><p>"Calling me?" Mo Fan looked up at the tall and imposing Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>In front of others, Mu Zhuoyun had an aura of royalty, making many young subordinates dare not breathe a word in his presence.</p><p>But that wasn't the case with Mo Fan. Aside from having a beautiful daughter, this fellow exuded nothing but old rogue vibes all over.</p>
