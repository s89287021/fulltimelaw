						<p>"Wind Track? Flash Step!" Zhang Xiaohou quickly attracted the attention of the huge-eyed squirrel rat covered in fresh blood. Relying on his Level 2 Wind Track, Zhang Xiaohou moved deftly among the haphazardly parked vehicles. Every time the giant-eyed squirrel rat tried to tear open Zhang Xiaohou's chest with its sharp claws, it only caught a puff of air left behind by him.</p><p>"Monkey, be careful, there's another one!!" Mo Fan had already climbed onto the bus and saw the glinting figure crouching behind an advertisement board at the bus stop.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou moved swiftly, with a pair of fang-toothed giant rats hot on his trail. How could he spare any time to pay attention to the position of the huge-eyed squirrel rat?</p><p>Mo Fan had seen the direction in which the demon powder was fluttering to locate that incredibly cunning huge-eyed squirrel rat.</p><p>These demons lived in an environment where the weak preyed upon the strong, and their hunting methods were far more brutal than those of humans living comfortably in cities. Even mages who had never experienced monster hunting could be killed; just like Zhang Yinglu, as a Wind Mage, she didn't know that she should always keep her Wind Track activated...</p><p>"Look quickly, its neck is stretching," Zhou Min also spotted the huge-eyed squirrel rat behind the bus advertisement board and hurriedly told Mo Fan.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Mo Fan inwardly cursed. </p><p>The abilities of the huge-eyed squirrel rat were not limited to biting and clawing; the most terrifying was the crimson beam it shot from its pupils. That was a fearsome force capable of piercing through a human body.</p><p>At that moment, the huge-eyed squirrel rat's gaze was fixed on Zhang Xiaohou.</p><p>"Radiance of Blindness!"</p><p>In Mo Fan's moment of extreme anxiety, Xue Muren spoke with an authoritative voice.</p><p>A ball of pale white light emitted scorching rays and suddenly appeared before the huge-eyed squirrel rat, which had stretched out its long neck.</p><p>The light was extremely intense; it seemed to be melting the paint on the advertisement board. The students inside the bus hurriedly closed their eyes, but they could still feel the searing pain of the bright light.</p><p>The Radiance exploded in front of the huge-eyed squirrel rat's eyes, and the blinding rays pierced into the dilated pupils of this giant-eyed creature like sword blades. One could see its cornea burning and rapidly spreading to the entire eye socket!!</p><p>The huge-eyed squirrel rat, which was about to shoot a crimson beam, was essentially blinded by this Radiance. It emitted piteous cries and collided haphazardly.</p><p>It was only then that Zhang Xiaohou realized there was another huge-eyed squirrel rat behind the advertisement board. He quickly changed his position, shook off the pursuing monster, and returned to the group.</p><p>"Teacher Xue, thank you!" Zhang Xiaohou said, panting slightly.</p><p>This beam of radiant light directly blinded one of the giant eye rats that threatened everyone. The remaining rat wouldn't stand a chance once they had time to connect the star orbits!</p><p>It was Mo Fan who made the first move. He was the fastest among all of them in completing the star orbit. His Tier 3 fire magic left no room for the giant eye rat to dodge, and an angry burst of flame roared in front of the same giant eye rat that had killed Zhang Yinglu!</p><p>"BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The explosion instantly triggered the deafening alarms on the cars nearby, shattering countless car windows with Mo Fan's Fire Burst.</p><p>The giant eye rat was slammed against a tightly closed iron roller door at a nearby bubble tea shop. Its fur burned completely, and its flesh burst open, revealing meat and bones filled with glass shards!</p><p>Xue Mingsheng turned around to look at Mo Fan, who had controlled the flames to kill the giant eye rat. A trace of surprise and delight flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Truly deserving of Tier 3 Fire Burst, this power actually knocked out the demon so severely that it could barely get up again. Having Mo Fan, such a powerful student, as part of the vanguard team should ensure they wouldn't be wiped out entirely.</p><p>"This beast, I will skin it alive!!" Wang Sanpang and Zhang Xiaohou were clearly extremely angry.</p><p>Just now, the beast had bitten their female classmate to death. They had only known that she would soon step into a beautiful magic university in just a few days, but instead, she was killed by such an ugly thing. Who could control the anger surging from their hearts?</p><p>"Don't go over there! It's not dead!" Mo Fan immediately shouted.</p><p>Just as Wang Sanpang was about to seek revenge for Zhang Yinglu, the giant eye rat, which seemed almost lifeless, suddenly sprang up, its fangs aimed at Wang Sanpang.</p><p>Wang Sanpang's face turned pale, and he instinctively rolled to the side.</p><p>The sharp fangs bit into his shoulder, tearing off a bloody chunk of flesh. Everyone couldn't help but gasp in horror.</p><p>"Beast, die!" Xu Zhaoting, enraged, sent out lightning seals that twisted their bodies like lightning whips towards this incredibly cunning giant eye rat.</p><p>Wang Sanpan stumbled and crawled back to the bus, blood trickling down his shoulder. His face, filled with fear, was pale as death.</p><p>Xu Shaoting, Zhou Min, and Zhang Shuhua unleashed a series of magic attacks that reduced the giant-eyed rat to ruins.</p><p>This time, the giant-eyed rat was thoroughly dead, but there was not a hint of relief on anyone's face.</p><p>Was this what true demons were like??</p><p>Murder could happen in an instant; any negligence would result in a mage dying a premature death!</p><p>"S-Sorry for reminding you; otherwise, Wang Sanpan would have met the same fate as Zhang Yinglu," Xu Shaoting said to Mo Fan in a daze.</p><p>Xue Musheng nodded heavily. Even he had not expected their supposedly strongest student team to suffer one death and one injury on their first encounter with a demon.</p><p>"Mo Fan, you seem to have a deeper understanding of the demons' habits; lead the team and command. I and He Yu will take responsibility for protection. He Yu... though it's extremely improper to say this at such a time, you witnessed Zhang Yinglu being killed. Now is not the moment to cower on the ground or mourn the dead. Please release a water-based defensive skill next time a demon attacks any of us; otherwise, the nine of us remaining might not survive until we reach the safety barrier... and the thousands following us would lose their direction," Xue Musheng said seriously to He Yu, who was in a daze from fright.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I can't complete the Starmap..." Tears streamed down He Yu's face. She was terrified of meeting the same fate as Zhang Yinglu.</p><p>"Use your best ability; if you can understand that releasing a water barrier means saving our lives, I believe you can do it," Xue Musheng said.</p>
