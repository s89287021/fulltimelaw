						<p>"Good job, Mu Bai!" Zhao Kun san jumped out from a corner, excitedly exclaiming.</p><p>"It was too terrifying; I don't think I'll ever trust anyone again in my life."</p><p>Mo Fan took a long breath and glanced at the green tea... oh, Mu Bai.</p><p>This time, it was thanks to this second-generation demon that they managed. Without his extravagantly luxurious demon-slaying weapon, who knew how many lives would have been lost to get rid of this White Sun Instructor.</p><p>"How are the others?" Xue Museng asked.</p><p>The students who had hidden around gradually gathered together, with only Zhang Xiao Hou still dazed and standing by the fence.</p><p>With the battle over and He Yu's blood drained dry, looking at that carpet-like pool of fresh red blood, a sense of sorrow and solemnity once again enveloped everyone.</p><p>"Monkey, let's go," Mo Fan walked up to Zhang Xiao Hou, unsure what words could comfort him.</p><p>Seeing Mo Fan, Zhang Xiao Hou seemed to have completely collapsed emotionally, tears streaming down his face.</p><p>"Big Brother Fan, I want to get stronger..." Zhang Xiao Hou frantically wiped away his tears, almost shouting in a vow, "I will definitely, definitely become stronger!!!"</p><p>Zhang Xiao Hou's words echoed in Mo Fan's ears, but Mo Fan was somewhat stunned.</p><p>Looking at this companion who always acted like a silly little brother...</p><p>At this moment, he cried like a child, yet his heart was fiercely washed clean and matured under the scalding blood!</p><p>Yes, only by becoming stronger could one protect those around them.</p><p>...</p><p>Crossing the bridge, that light screen barrier resembling a city wall had already come into view.</p><p>The remaining eight, with their weary faces finally breaking into a faint smile, clearly saw the mages wearing the emblem of the Magic Association guarding over there.</p><p>This three-kilometer stretch of road was longer than anything they had experienced in their previous seventeen years. No matter what, they had arrived.</p><p>"The main force is now a kilometer and a half away from us. I hope they have made it here safely as well," Xue Mushi said, looking back.</p><p>Zhao Min, Xu Zhao ting, Wang Sanpang, Zhang Shuhua, and the others nodded their heads. They had fulfilled their duties as the vanguard squad, having experienced such life-and-death peril. They sincerely hoped that the main force would arrive safely; they no longer wanted to see more bloodshed.</p><p>"Who is Mo Fan?" A man with a military emblem on his chest walked up to them and asked.</p><p>"I am," Mo Fan raised his head, drenched in sweat and looking equally exhausted.</p><p>"Come over here. The leader wants to see you," the man said.</p><p>Mo Fan nodded and followed the Magic Association's military officer toward a temporary lookout tower constructed using earth-elemental magic.</p><p>The lookout tower was very tall, and it took them a long time climbing up the winding staircase before they finally reached the top.</p><p>At the top was an open-air observation platform. The fierce winds from above rushed in, causing their cheeks to sting.</p><p>On the edge of the observation platform without railings stood a man in a blue military windbreaker, standing with his hands behind his back, his wild hair billowing in the wind.</p><p>To the left and right of the man stood rows of army mages also wearing blue windbreakers. Their coats flapped high, their tall figures standing at the very edge of the observation platform unmoving, exuding an aura of authority without any need for anger, as if they were sculptures. The leader in the middle, Zhankaung, had a presence that was even more awe-inspiring than Mo Fan had previously seen in the shameless Zhankaung, the Chief Instructor.</p><p>The ten army mages, including Zhankaung the leader, all emitted powerful auras, likely at least intermediate-level mages!</p><p>They were gazing far away, their eyes like swords piercing the dome of the Silver Trade Building, which was the mastermind behind the disaster in Bo City—Demon Lord Wing Canglang!</p><p>"Leader, Mo Fan is here," that man saluted and slowly retreated.</p><p>Zhankaung did not turn around, and the entire observation platform fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Seeing you alive, I am very happy." Zhan Kong’s language did not have its usual carefree manner; even saying the two words "happy" lacked genuine emotion.</p><p>Zhan Kong at this moment was far from being the chief instructor Mo Fan recognized. Perhaps this was his true face—dignified and coldly arrogant!</p><p>"Do you know what I wanted to do most when I saw you?" Mo Fan retorted.</p><p>"I wanted to give you a good dressing-down. Bai Yang being a member of the Black Church indeed shocked all of us. Fortunately, your suspicion of him saved your life," Zhan Kong said.</p><p>He had already learned about their situation through his subordinates’ reports. Zhan Kong was genuinely surprised; even their military department had not detected Bai Yang’s malicious intentions as an army mage. Why did Mo Fan suspect him?</p><p>"You showed some reflection. When we went to the cave guarded by Instructor Bai for training, I noticed that the water in the spring at the mountain entrance clearly showed signs of having been drunk from, and it didn’t seem like just one person had done so. Afterward, I also asked Instructor Bai if he had any other summoned beasts, and he replied that he did not."</p><p>"Based on such far-fetched evidence, you think there was something wrong with him?" Zhan Kong laughed incredulously.</p><p>"The sudden madness of the Shadow Wolf Beast back then was another issue. Actually, I didn’t want to believe that Instructor Bai was a spy either; I couldn’t be completely sure. I just kept my guard up, little did I know he would really turn against us," Mo Fan said.</p><p>Mo Fan only had a few doubts. If he were very certain of his suspicions, the moment he saw Instructor Bai, he definitely would have warned those around him. Moreover, Mo Fan hadn’t considered the appearance of the Black Beast Demon.</p><p>"What about the Holy Spring?" Zhan Kong did not continue to discuss the spy but returned to this most important issue.</p><p>"Thirsty, so I drank it," Mo Fan replied lightly.</p><p>Standing at the edge of the lookout tower, Zhan Kong nearly slipped and fell down. The dignity and arrogance he had just cultivated vanished in an instant.</p><p>Zhan Kong turned around and stared straight at Mo Fan.</p><p>Damn it, are you kidding me? Do you think you can use the Holy Spring like a bottle of Aquarius when you’re thirsty? That is the true essence of Bo City accumulated over thousands of years! Even if it has lost much of its magic due to the passage of time, compared to the entire country, it remains the coveted treasure for mages’ cultivation. This kid just… drank it straight like water??</p><p>"Now is not the time for jokes," Zhan Kong’s expression turned serious as he stared at Mo Fan.</p>
