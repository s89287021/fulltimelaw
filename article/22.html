						<p>Mu Ningxue's words were very brief, and Mo Fan had no idea what the boys were excited about. They talked as if Mu Ningxue could really get into the Imperial Capital Academy.</p><p>The Imperial Capital Academy was naturally the best magic university in the country, and for a city like Bocity to have a few students admitted each year was already impressive.</p><p>With such a low admission rate, it clearly showed how exceptional Mu Ningxue was to be specially admitted to the Imperial Capital Academy without attending a magic high school.</p><p>"Fanbro, put in more effort these two years and get into the capital as well. Once you're at the Imperial Capital Academy, no matter how long the Mu family tries to reach you, they won't be able to manage it. Then... hehehe," Zhang Xiaohou said.</p><p>Just as Zhang Xiaohou spoke, that persistent Zhao Kunsan jumped out again.</p><p>"Don't laugh so hard; after today, your Fanbro will be expelled from school, let alone the Imperial Capital Academy!" Zhao Kunsan taunted.</p><p>"Zhao Kunsan, are you sick or something? When did your Fanbro offend you? Why do you jump out and bark like a dog every time we say one word?" Zhang Xiaohou had long endured Zhao Kunsan's antics.</p><p>Zhang Xiaohou was at least an outstanding student in the class, one of the few who could cast spells. He didn't know what capital Zhao Kunsan, who could only control six stars, had to bark at him about.</p><p>"You haven't offended me, but I just can't stand this shameless little prick. I really don't understand how you had the courage to get close to Miss Mu Ningxue back then. You should recognize your worth; don't have delusions of grandeur. If not for you, our Zhao Family Village's land wouldn't have been reclaimed!" Zhao Kunsan accused Mo Fan, pointing at him.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan was also from this district and could be considered a servant to the Mu family.</p><p>The term "servant" might seem out of place in modern times, but if your livelihood depended on the Mu family matriarch's love for flowers, wouldn't Zhao Family, who had been responsible for maintaining the garden and flowers, be nothing more than gardeners and servants?</p><p>The Mu family estate was enormous, like an old-time nobleman's estate, where there might have been only a hundred nobles in the entire estate, but thousands of farmers, commoners, and servants would surround them.</p><p>Old folks said that this whole district used to belong to the Mu family. Bocity's true first aristocratic family; many families like Mo Fan's and Zhao Kunsan's had survived around them.</p><p>Zhao Kunsan held a grudge against Mo Fan. If not for his audacity in angering the patriarch, they gardeners could have lived well!</p><p>"I say, Mo Fan, why don't you use your head? I've always known that some people are out of our reach. It's better to keep your distance early on; it's good for both yourself and your family. Don't go seeking death, thinking a toad can eat swan meat. Do you think this is a novel or TV drama where a herdboy marries a princess? Stop dreaming!" Zhao Kunsan scornfully pointed at Mo Fan.</p><p>This appearance of Mu Ningxue had thoroughly stirred up the resentment that Zhao Kunsan had kept inside all along.</p><p>In those days, Mo Fan's foolish actions affected too many people and too many families.</p><p>A princess is a princess; one should keep a respectful distance if necessary.</p><p>This is not a fairy tale. If you cross that line, the king can increase taxes in anger, making life unbearable for the hardworking families in the entire village or town!</p><p>Today, the middle-aged man standing slightly behind the podium, with silver hair and an air of youthful vigor, is the King!</p><p>His name is Mu Zhuoyun, a person who could make all of Bocheng tremble just by stomping his foot.</p><p>The person Mo Fan offended was him.</p><p>It can be said that not letting Mo Fan's family fall into poverty today already shows his mercy!</p><p>"Zhao Kunsan, can you shut your mouth!"</p><p>"What? Did I say something wrong?" Zhao Kunsan replied.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at Zhao Kunsan.</p><p>To be honest, these words from him surprised Mo Fan. This guy was indeed much clearer about reality than he had imagined.</p><p>Some people only realize it when they are very old how foolish it is to mock those with poor grades but wealthy families in class. In society, the so-called rich fools return from overseas studies with impressive degrees and can easily find jobs paying tens of thousands of yuan per month, finding it insufficient, while he himself, who worked hard to get into a good university, was drowned in the sea of workers, living a life incomparable to those he once mocked, losing his ideals, losing his fighting spirit, exhausted and still poor!</p><p>What Zhao Kunsan said revealed a more mature way of thinking than his peers. In fact, it is better to realize oneself early rather than foolishly chasing dreams, otherwise, when reality strikes, all the aspirations one had would vanish in an instant, like a nightmare that is hard to accept!</p><p>Of course, Mo Fan had no reason to admire Zhao Kunsan for being realistic; instead, he found it laughable.</p><p>"Zhao Kunsan, you have great potential and awareness to be a dog, something I, Mo Fan, will never achieve. Admire yourself!"</p><p>Mo Fan shot back.</p><p>"What the hell are you? If I were a dog, I would be eating high-quality dog food, living in a small villa, wearing beautiful clothes, a pampered dog! You're a stray, a drowning dog, a garbage-eating dog, don't you see what kind of waste you are emitting? Most valuable is that you still don't know how stinky you are, forcing your family's last bit of property into this magic high school, only to be kicked out. I just want to ask Mo Jia Xing, your father, doesn't he regret having given birth to you? You're nothing but a broomstick!" Zhao Kunsan continued to curse.</p><p>Mo Fan's recent scolding had directly hit Zhao Kunsan's pain point, but Zhao Kunsan was no pushover either. He admitted to being a dog and then bit back at Mo Fan.</p><p>Mo Fan glanced at the crowd.</p><p>Sure enough, he spotted the person whose eyes glinted with schadenfreude—Mu Bai.</p><p>This was that young master who had been beaten up by him before when he was living in someone else's home.</p><p>Well, when they were younger, everyone was just kids, and revenge usually involved throwing stones at someone's windows, nothing serious.</p><p>Now, people's fates would be drastically altered by the awakening of magic and the magical examinations. Mu Bai, who had risen to prominence, finally had an opportunity for retaliation!</p><p>For now, let Zhao Kun this dog go. With a well-planned move, he would find a more suitable time to strike hard.</p><p>Eight wrongs make a right—those brats whom I used to beat up into dogs are now learning how to play tricks. It wasn't in vain that I had educated them like a father for so many years.</p><p>Come on, show me what you've got.</p><p>I, Mo Fan, specialize in taking down trolls and superiority complexes; I've never failed. Humiliating people and seeking revenge with a vengeful eye—this is my specialty!</p>
