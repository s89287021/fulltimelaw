						<p>She and Mo Fan were both still young, and it was difficult for them to alleviate Uncle Xing's worries at home. All they could do was study hard and become true magicians to relieve the current family crisis.</p><p>It seemed that Mo Fan's older brother was indeed more capable; he learned magic in such a short time...</p><p>Hmm, something is wrong!</p><p>Suddenly, Ye Xinxia realized something as she looked at Mo Fan with those beautiful, expressive eyes of hers.</p><p>Mo Fan said solemnly, "What's the matter?"</p><p>"You've been awake for less than half a year. According to what I know, even someone with great talent still needs nearly a year to master basic skills," Ye Xinxia said.</p><p>Mo Fan was taken aback.</p><p>Could it be that it actually takes a year from awakening to mastering skills, even for those with great talent??</p><p>Then... then he completed the basic application in less than half a year, which is indeed very fast!</p><p>The problem was, Mo Fan didn't know this at all.</p><p>In his view, Mu Bai the idiot could already control four or five stars, so it wasn't unusual for him to be able to release magic.</p><p>But why did Ye Xinxia look so incredulous, almost as if she were looking at a monster?</p><p>Could it be that learning basic skills in less than half a year was really abnormal in this world??</p><p>"What do you mean by 'even someone with great talent also needs a year'? What level of talent are you referring to?" Mo Fan asked cautiously.</p><p>Mo Fan didn't want to reveal his ignorance about this world.</p><p>"Muningsnow is considered the most talented person in our city, even surpassing many geniuses in the capital. However, it still took her eight months from awakening to mastering basic ice skills," Ye Xinxia said.</p><p>"8... eight months?" Mo Fan was quite stunned.</p><p>Who was Mu Ningxue?</p><p>She was the only person in all of Bole City to be directly admitted by the Imperial Capital Academy, and she was also the pride and joy of the entire Mu family. Since childhood, she had been immersed in the thick magical atmosphere of the Mu family, possessing cultivation resources that an ordinary civilian mage could never obtain.</p><p>And her popularity among everyone was closely related to her astonishing magical talent!</p><p>Even such a heaven-favored daughter like her took eight months to go from awakening to releasing basic spells, then what about himself who had done it in five months???</p><p>F*ck me!!</p><p>Damn it!!</p><p>Mo Fan felt his heart churning violently!</p><p>If Mu Ningxue was already shocking the world with her eight-month accomplishment and being called a prodigy, then wouldn't he be defying heaven with his five months??</p><p>"Big Brother Mo Fan, did you... learn some bad things... I heard from an old scholar that people with such cultivation speed can only be from the Black Church," Ye Xinxia whispered very quietly.</p><p>Certain dark magic techniques of the Black Church could greatly increase a mage's cultivation speed. Ye Xinxia couldn't think of anything else that would enable someone to complete basic spells in just five months, even though she knew her big brother Mo Fan had always been exceptionally intelligent...</p><p>"Black Church? Impossible... yes, you're right... oh, right, I actually didn't awaken on the day of the opening ceremony. I met an old man earlier, and he told me that a young man like you has extraordinary bones and talent, so why not learn magic from me? I asked him who he was, and he said he was a member of the Magic Association in Megalopolis City and could help me awaken... in short, I didn't actually learn it in five months," Mo Fan explained quickly.</p><p>Ye Xinxia looked completely puzzled.</p><p>But she smiled and said, "So you awakened first. Although awakening too early can have cultivation side effects, since he's from the Magic Association, there shouldn't be much of a problem."</p><p>Seeing that Ye Xinxia wasn't going to ask any more questions, Mo Fan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Damn, he really was a monster. It seemed that before fully understanding this world, it would be best not to reveal too much about himself.</p><p>"Was it really only the Black Vatican that could achieve this in five months?" Mo Fan asked weakly.</p><p>"Yeah," Ye Xinxia nodded seriously.</p><p>Mo Fan was drenched in cold sweat!</p><p>Being too impressive wasn't a good thing either. Originally, Mo Fan wanted to give Ye Xinxia the surprise of her own fire magic. Now it seemed best not to act recklessly until he fully understood the situation.</p><p>He should first go back and consult some books to get a clearer picture; it would be safer that way. He didn't want to end up being treated like the Black Vatican by mistake!</p><p>(Monday, comrades!! If you're unhappy with work or school, just use your recommendation votes to bash me to death and let off some steam. After all, I don't have to go to work or school, so it doesn't matter what day it is~~)</p>
