						<p>"Teacher Tang... Teacher Tang Yue, did you give Mo Fan some special treatment? How could he become so extreme?" Xu Zhao Ting couldn't help but ask.</p><p>This time, the lightning prodigy Xu Zhao Ting was thoroughly convinced.</p><p>Xu Zhao Ting had only mastered a Level 2 lightning skill half a year ago and thought he had narrowed the gap with Mo Fan. Who would have thought that Mo Fan's cultivation progressed like riding a rocket? If it weren't for Teacher Tang Yue giving him special treatment, how could Xu Zhao Ting believe it?</p><p>"No, it's all due to his own hard work," Tang Yue shook her head.</p><p>Tang Yue was the only one who knew about Mo Fan's possession of the Stardust Magic Tool. She could roughly guess that Mo Fan had cultivated higher than everyone imagined, but she never expected him to have already mastered Level 3 Fire Surge!</p><p>Mu Bai's entire face turned green with envy.</p><p>He couldn't seem to even touch the edge of Mo Fan anymore. This Level 3 Fire Surge was heading straight for his face, ready to end his life at any moment!</p><p>"Zhuo Yun... Big Brother Zhuo Yun..." Mu He sat there, his face as stiff as stone.</p><p>Mu Zhuo Yun's chest had already risen and fallen dramatically, his face filled with anger but more so with astonishment!</p><p>"I really underestimated him!" Finally, Mu Zhuo Yun was forced to admit this.</p><p>Mu He couldn't help glancing at Mo Jia Xing sitting in a relatively secluded spot.</p><p>Could it be that this stupid driver was about to turn things around? By selling his family's fortune to send little Mo Fan to the Magic Academy, he actually created a magic genius??</p><p>Level 3 Fire Surge. Just look at how many resources Yu Ang consumed to reach Level 3 Ice Vines!!</p><p>...</p><p>On the battlefield, those wildly dancing ice and snow finally began to fade, allowing people to gradually see the proud student Mo Fan standing there.</p><p>On the opposite side of Mo Fan, the Ice Dust Shield summoned by him had completely transformed into tiny ice particles scattered on the ground. Meanwhile, Yao Ang, who was originally protected by the Ice Dust, had been blasted away to a distance of about four or five meters. His white outfit, which resembled that of a prince, had been blown to tatters, and he lay there embarrassingly, having completely lost the aura of today's protagonist!</p><p>The snow finally fell, and after Mo Fan and his companions warmed up, they started walking towards Yao Ang on the ground.</p><p>Dammit, did you really think you were the only one who mastered a Level 3 skill??</p><p>Let you show off, I'll blast you to death!</p><p>"Interesting, haha, very interesting!" Suddenly, the utterly embarrassed Yao Ang stood up from the snowy ground.</p><p>Mo Fan was somewhat surprised. This guy still had his wits about him.</p><p>In theory, although the Ice Shield blocked most of the effects of the Fire Burst Explosion, it could not block the explosive wave of flames. That alone should have knocked Yao Ang out...</p><p>"Really? A Level 3 Fire Burst didn't knock Yao Ang down??"</p><p>"This guy's body is made of iron, right!"</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun scoffed at this point, silently cursing himself for having prepared an additional armor magic tool for Yao Ang, otherwise he would have been tricked by this cunning kid.</p><p>Mo Fan almost won the duel. The power of Fire Burst Explosion was virtually unstoppable at this level, but unfortunately no one expected Mu Zhuoyun to be so scheming!</p><p>"Leg Magic Tool, Shield Magic Tool, and an extremely expensive Armor Magic Tool, are you that extravagant!!" The Zhou-surnamed man couldn't help shouting.</p><p>Principal Zhu and Deng Kai were also stunned.</p><p>Armor Magic Tools were defensive magic tools whose value exceeded that of shield magic tools. Shield Magic Tools provided limited defense and could not block certain skills. In contrast, Armor Magic Tools could block almost all attacks except mental ones, providing 360-degree protection to the body when worn directly.</p><p>"Forgot to mention, as a birthday gift for my son's eighteenth birthday, I specially gave him this Ice Silk Armor to protect against sneak attacks." Mu Zhuoyun stroked his beard and slowly addressed the guests.</p><p>"What the heck? This is just a duel; with all these magic tools, why don't everyone fight without them? It's too shameless!" Zhou Min, who was impatient, finally spoke out.</p><p>Xu Zhao Ting, Wang Sanpan, and a few others were equally indignant.</p><p>Without the magic tools, Yu Ang that guy would have already been beaten into a pulp by Mo Fan. Level three Fire Surge was definitely the rhythm of teaching people!</p><p>"Background is also a form of strength," Mu Zhuoyun remained unmoved, explaining calmly.</p><p>"What a pity... what a pity, this student named Mo Fan has already done very well, but he still lost in the magic tools," Yang Zuoheshan sighed heavily.</p><p>Many people present felt sorry for Mo Fan.</p><p>His display of Level Three Fire Surge today was enough to make him superior to all his peers in Boge City and even make many descendants of noble families feel ashamed. However, fights are fights, and losses are losses. Just as Mu Zhuoyun said, background is also a form of strength. This truth many people only understand after entering society.</p><p>"You really chose a good father!" Mo Fan looked at the Ice Silk Armor peeking out from Yu Ang's tattered clothes, similarly igniting a bit of anger in his heart.</p><p>Another footgear magic tool, another shield magic tool, and now an armor magic tool. There was no way to live!</p><p>Yu Ang still laughed, an extremely repulsive laugh.</p><p>"To be honest, you did pretty well. I thought you were just intentionally trying to draw attention as a clown, turns out you were concealing your skills and planning to shock everyone with this opportunity. What a pity, just a little more, just a little more, hahaha!" Yu Ang laughed loudly, not caring at all if Mo Fan used Fire Surge Burst again.</p><p>"Deng Kai is right. Next comes the Ice Vine, and you'll become an ice statue. Thawing you will be troublesome. Come now, kneel in front of my godfather as a sign of surrender. Consider this a small mercy from me for having such a decent opponent."</p><p>Yu Ang stood there, looking down at Mo Fan like a superior while wearing the Ice Silk Armor.</p><p>How arrogant Yu Ang's gaze was!</p><p>How infuriating Mu Zhuoyun's cunning smile was!</p><p>Is background also a form of strength??</p><p>Mo Fan also wanted to laugh, but at the moment he couldn't. Looking around at all the guests present, and surveying the important figures of Boheng City in attendance, it seemed as though everyone tacitly approved of Mu Zhuoyun's words. They were looking at him with a hint of sympathy.</p>
