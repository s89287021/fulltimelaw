						<p>Xu Zhaoting saw the result, and a look of satisfaction appeared on his face. </p><p>Turning around, he suddenly noticed a pair of eyes as bright as snow that were originally waiting for the examiner to announce the results.</p><p>It was Mu Ningxue!</p><p>Xu Zhaoting's face was filled with surprise and delight.</p><p>He hadn't expected that his exam had already caught Mu Ningxue's attention.</p><p>She must be quite surprised, after all, the power of the lightning element is unmatched by any other element.</p><p>...</p><p>"ningxue, what do you think?" asked Mu He, the school director, with a smile.</p><p>"Average," Mu Ningxue didn't look at him again and chose to continue walking forward.</p><p>The principal and other school leaders' faces stiffened.</p><p>No way, she finds such a powerful lightning element user average? This girl must have very high standards.</p><p>"Haha, actually it's quite good. Ningxue studied at the Imperial Capital Academy, where national magic geniuses congregate. Basic skills like releasing low-level lightning seals are just their foundation. She feels it's average because she has gotten used to measuring by the standards of the Imperial Capital Academy," Mu Zhuoyun explained with a smile, providing an excuse for the principal and Mu He.</p><p>"So, Xu Zhaoting still has a good chance of getting into the Imperial Capital Academy?" The principal, who was also skilled at climbing ladders, seized the opportunity to say.</p><p>The others immediately echoed him, lost in their own admiration.</p><p>"Unless something unexpected happens, Xu Zhaoting will likely be first in the school," said Chen Guangliang, the head of the student affairs office.</p><p>"That's not certain. As far as I know, Mu Bai from Class Eight is also a formidable opponent," said the vice-principal.</p><p>When the two said this, Mu He's face also broke into a smile. He immediately turned to Mu Zhuoyun and Mu Ningxue, saying, "Big brother, Mu Bai is our Mu family’s descendant; his performance has always been excellent. In my opinion, he should be close to finishing up there as well. Shall we go take a look?"</p><p>"Mu Bai? Which branch's?"</p><p>"It's the son of Mu Yang. Didn't Mu Yang pass away? I saw that mother and son were being bullied elsewhere, so I brought them to live in the manor. Mu Bai is also a very sensible and hardworking child; he’s not inferior to any other children in our family… oh, of course, there's a huge gap between him and Ningxue. However, he is still a good prospect for cultivation."</p><p>Mu He carefully explained to Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>The manor was entirely under the control of Mu Zhuoyun. Although Mu He was considered a master, he was only a third or fourth in command and could not compare with Mu Zhuoyun.</p><p>"Oh, I have a vague memory of him. Then let's go take a look. What are the other board members' opinions?"</p><p>Mu Zhuoyun said.</p><p>The middle-aged sandy-haired chairman spoke up, "Since he is a descendant of the Mu family, we are indeed very interested."</p><p>A group of people began to move, slowly heading towards the exam hall of Class Eight.</p><p>These people had an overwhelming presence. To students, leaders might seem like distant figures, but to Mu Ningxue, who was a genius of their age, they were a wake-up call.</p><p>On the field, the boys immediately became energized when they saw girls watching, especially since this girl was the dream goddess of the entire school.</p><p>"Oh my God, the board members are coming over."</p><p>"They really came. My hands are shaking."</p><p>"It's perfect timing for me to show off."</p><p>"Show off what? Your assessment is already done, you scum who got a C!"</p><p>The students of Class Eight were no longer calm.</p><p>Everyone’s fate hung in the balance on this annual assessment, and just one approving glance from the board members could change their lives. As the board members approached, the exam atmosphere instantly became incredibly tense.</p><p>Mu He led the way at the front, and the bald examiner immediately looked up to meet Mu He's eyes.</p><p>Mu He gave Mu Bai a subtle hint, and the bald examiner immediately understood. Mu Bai pretended not to have seen anything and calmly said, "Next, Mu Bai!"</p><p>Mu Bai’s eyes were still fixed on Mu Ningxue. Even though they lived in the same castle, it was so large that Mu Bai had rarely stood this close to Mu Ningxue.</p><p>"Mu Bai, it's your turn," Mu He coughed to remind him.</p><p>Only then did Mu Bai realize what was happening.</p><p>There was no help for it; he had loved Mu Ningxue for too long. Even though he knew it was unlikely that they would end up together, he couldn’t tolerate being taken away by trash like Mo Fan. He had to be a protector!</p><p>It was time to prove all his hard work!</p><p>Mu Bai nodded and walked towards the examination room.</p><p>He had been waiting for this moment for a long time. Mu Bai took a deep breath.</p><p>The family’s recognition and Mu Ningxue’s gaze were what he had dreamed of all along, and both would come true today.</p><p>Mu Bai had indeed received extensive training in this area. Although his mind was extremely excited and tense at that moment, he still performed excellent meditation with his proficiency.</p><p>White ice rays rapidly spread out from the star-sensing stone and covered it entirely.</p><p>These ice rays were very intense, almost overflowing from the star-sensing stone and imprinting on Mu Bai’s face.</p><p>The entire class watched in awe.</p><p>Overflowing light was something they had never seen in so many exams. Even Zhou Min with her A++ grade paled in comparison to Mu Bai's overflowing light!</p><p>"s!"</p><p>"s!"</p><p>"s!"</p><p>The three examiners immediately gave their scores, and all of them were s!</p><p>"I remember Xǔ Zhào Ting got two s's and one a just now, right?"</p><p>"So that means Mù Báixīng will win over Xǔ Zhào Ting!" Mù Hè said immediately.</p><p>Xue Mùshēng was also somewhat stunned at this point. Did Mù Báixīng still have hidden strength?</p><p>He truly is the son of a noble family, I thought Mù Báixīng could only get one s at most, but he got three!</p><p>Three s's means his final score must be s!</p><p>This is undoubtedly the top in the entire school, there's no doubt about it!</p><p>"Sh*t, Mù Báixīng is too damn good, getting three s's. This score directly leaves Xǔ Zhào Ting of Class Seven behind, he truly deserves to be first."</p><p>"I never thought, I never thought..."</p><p>"Mù Báixīng, you're really awesome!!"</p><p>Several girls were already blushing.</p><p>Mù Báixīng is handsome and his grades are the best, he's truly like their prince charming in their hearts.</p><p>"Big brother, what do you think?" Mù Hè smiled and asked Mu Zhuóyún beside him.</p><p>"Not bad," Mu Zhuóyún simply commented briefly.</p><p>Mu Ningxue did not speak.</p><p>Seeing that Mu Ningxue remained unmoved, Mu Bai knew that three S ranks were nothing in front of such a genius as Mu Ningxue. It was the release that would truly showcase himself!</p><p>Mu Bai turned around and walked into the examination hall.</p><p>"Mu Bai is releasing!"</p><p>"Nonsense, Mu Bai must have already mastered all seven stars."</p><p>"I'm looking forward to seeing his ice skills."</p><p>Amidst the chatter, Mu Bai stared intently at the mannequin figure.</p><p>That's right, the stardust test was just a foundation; anyone with some knowledge understood that it was the release that truly mattered.</p><p>I will definitely make Chief and Mu Ningxue look at me in a new light!</p><p>Closing his eyes, he entered the magical preparation stance.</p><p>Mu Bai skillfully connected all seven ice attribute stars into a star trail.</p>
